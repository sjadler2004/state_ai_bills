# state_ai_bills

`bill_texts` contains scrapes of the nominally AI-related bills available on the NCSL's website as of June 30, 2025. When multiple versions of the bill are available, the JSON contains each version, with a flag for which version is the latest, which is the version used for analysis purposes. I plan to come back and also add my analysis and code.
