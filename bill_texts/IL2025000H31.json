(a) Each public body shall make available to any person for inspection or copying all public records, except as otherwise provided in Sections 7 and 8.5 of this Act. Notwithstanding any other law, a public body may not grant to any person or entity, whether by contract, license, or otherwise, the exclusive right to access and disseminate any public record as defined in this Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Subject to the fee provisions of Section 6 of this Act, each public body shall promptly provide, to any person who submits a request, a copy of any public record required to be disclosed by subsection (a) of this Section and shall certify such copy if so requested.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Requests for inspection or copies shall be made in writing and directed to the public body. Written requests may be submitted to a public body via personal delivery, mail, telefax, or other means available to the public body. A public body may honor oral requests for inspection or copying. A public body may not require that a request be submitted on a standard form or require the requester to specify the purpose for a request, except to determine whether the records are requested for a commercial purpose or whether to grant a request for a fee waiver. All requests for inspection and copying received by a public body shall immediately be forwarded to its Freedom of Information officer or designee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Each public body shall, promptly, either comply with or deny a request for public records within 5 business days after its receipt of the request, unless the time for response is properly extended under subsection (e) of this Section. Denial shall be in writing as provided in Section 9 of this Act. Failure to comply with a written request, extend the time for response, or deny a request within 5 business days after its receipt shall be considered a denial of the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request within the requisite periods in this Section but thereafter provides the requester with copies of the requested public records may not impose a fee for such copies. A public body that fails to respond to a request received may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under subsection (g).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) The time for response under this Section may be extended by the public body for not more than 5 business days from the original due date for any of the following reasons:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations than the office having charge of the requested records;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified records;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive search for the records responsive to it;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine search and additional efforts are being made to locate them;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(v) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel having the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt from disclosure under Section 7 of this Act or should be revealed only with appropriate deletions;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(vi) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within the time limits prescribed by subsection (d) of this Section without unduly burdening or interfering with the operations of the public body;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(vii) there is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another public body or among 2 or more components of a public body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the subject matter of the request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The person making a request and the public body may agree in writing to extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If the requester and the public body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by the public body to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be treated as a denial of the request for the records.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) When additional time is required for any of the above reasons, the public body shall, within 5 business days after receipt of the request, notify the person making the request of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request within the time permitted for extension but thereafter provides the requester with copies of the requested public records may not impose a fee for those copies. A public body that requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome under subsection (g).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be complied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly burden its operation and the conditions described above are met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a response shall be treated as a denial of the request for information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Repeated requests from the same person for the same records that are unchanged or identical to records previously provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed unduly burdensome under this provision.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, including:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) the times and places where such records will be made available, and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the persons from whom such records may be obtained.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not apply to <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">automated requests,</u> requests for records made for a commercial purpose, requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests.

The response shall: (i) provide an estimate of the fees to be charged, which the public body may require the person to pay in full before copying the requested documents; (ii) deny the request pursuant to one or more of the exemptions set out in this Act; (iii) notify the requester that the request is unduly burdensome and extend an opportunity to the requester to attempt to reduce the request to manageable proportions; or (iv) provide the records requested.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) The time for response by the public body under subsection (c) of this Section may be extended by the public body for not more than 30 business days from the final day for the requester to respond to the public body&#39;s notification under subsection (c) of this Section for any of the reasons provided in subsection (e) of Section 3 of this Act. The person making a request and the public body may agree in writing to extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties.

Authority to charge fees.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) When a person requests a copy of a record maintained in an electronic format, the public body shall furnish it in the electronic format specified by the requester, if feasible. If it is not feasible to furnish the public records in the specified electronic format, then the public body shall furnish it in the format in which it is maintained by the public body, or in paper format at the option of the requester. A public body may charge the requester for the actual cost of purchasing the recording medium, whether disc, diskette, tape, or other medium. If a request is not <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">an automated request,</u> a request for a commercial purpose<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">,</u> or a voluminous request, a public body may not charge the requester for the costs of any search for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the records. Except to the extent that the General Assembly expressly provides, statutory fees applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a paper format shall not be applicable to those records when furnished in an electronic format.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a-5) If a voluminous request is for electronic records and those records are not in a portable document format (PDF), the public body may charge up to $20 for not more than 2 megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than 2 but not more than 4 megabytes of data, and up to $100 for more than 4 megabytes of data. If a voluminous request is for electronic records and those records are in a portable document format, the public body may charge up to $20 for not more than 80 megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than 80 megabytes but not more than 160 megabytes of data, and up to $100 for more than 160 megabytes of data. If the responsive electronic records are in both a portable document format and not in a portable document format, the public body may separate the fees and charge the requester under both fee scales.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">If a public body imposes a fee pursuant to this subsection (a-5), it must provide the requester with an accounting of all fees, costs, and personnel hours in connection with the request for public records.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Except when a fee is otherwise fixed by statute, each public body may charge fees reasonably calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing and certifying public records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment of the public body to copy records. No fees shall be charged for the first 50 pages of black and white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a requester. The fee for black and white, letter or legal sized copies shall not exceed 15 cents per page. If a public body provides copies in color or in a size other than letter or legal, the public body may not charge more than its actual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating its actual cost for reproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the public body to reproduce records, a public body shall not include the costs of any search for and review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the records, except for commercial requests as provided in subsection (f) of this Section. Such fees shall be imposed according to a standard scale of fees, established and made public by the body imposing them. The cost for certifying a record shall not exceed $1.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge, as determined by the public body, if the person requesting the documents states the specific purpose for the request and indicates that a waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or commercial benefit. For purposes of this subsection, &quot;commercial benefit&quot; shall not apply to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of the request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and welfare or the legal rights of the general public. In setting the amount of the waiver or reduction, the public body may take into consideration the amount of materials requested and the cost of copying them.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The imposition of a fee not consistent with subsections (6)(a) and (b) of this Act constitutes a denial of access to public records for the purposes of judicial review.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) The fee for each abstract of a driver&#39;s record shall be as provided in Section 6-118 of &quot;The Illinois Vehicle Code&quot;, approved September 29, 1969, as amended, whether furnished as a paper copy or as an electronic copy.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) A public body may charge up to $10 for each hour spent by personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested record or examining the record for necessary redactions. No fees shall be charged for the first 8 hours spent by personnel in searching for or retrieving a requested record. A public body may charge the actual cost of retrieving and transporting public records from an off-site storage facility when the public records are maintained by a third-party storage company under contract with the public body. If a public body imposes a fee pursuant to this subsection (f), it must provide the requester with an accounting of all fees, costs, and personnel hours in connection with the request for public records. The provisions of this subsection (f) apply only to commercial requests.</p>\n   <p class=\"left\">(Source: P.A. 97-579, eff. 8-26-11; 98-1129, eff. 12-3-14.)</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5 ILCS 140/9.5)</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9.5.

Within 7 business days after receipt of the request for review, the public body shall provide copies of records requested and shall otherwise fully cooperate with the Public Access Counselor.

Records or documents obtained by the Public Access Counselor from a public body for the purpose of addressing a request for review under this Section may not be disclosed to the public, including the requester, by the Public Access Counselor. These records, while in the possession of the Public Access Counselor, are exempt under this Act from disclosure by the Public Access Counselor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Within 7 business days after it receives a copy of a request for review and request for production of records from the Public Access Counselor, the public body may, but is not required to, answer the allegations of the request for review.

The Public Access Counselor shall forward a copy of the answer to the person submitting the request for review, with any alleged confidential information to which the request pertains redacted from the copy. The requester may, but is not required to, respond in writing to the answer within 7 business days and shall provide a copy of the response to the public body.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) In addition to the request for review, and the answer and the response thereto, if any, a requester or a public body may furnish affidavits or records concerning any matter germane to the review.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Unless the Public Access Counselor extends the time by no more than 30 business days by sending written notice to the requester and the public body that includes a statement of the reasons for the extension in the notice, or decides to address the matter without the issuance of a binding opinion, the Attorney General shall examine the issues and the records, shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and shall issue to the requester and the public body an opinion in response to the request for review within 60 days after its receipt. The opinion shall be binding upon both the requester and the public body, subject to administrative review under Section 11.5.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In responding to any request under this Section 9.5, the Attorney General may exercise his or her discretion and choose to resolve a request for review by mediation or by a means other than the issuance of a binding opinion. The decision not to issue a binding opinion shall not be reviewable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a violation of this Act has occurred, the public body shall either take necessary action immediately to comply with the directive of the opinion or shall initiate administrative review under Section 11.5. If the opinion concludes that no violation of the Act has occurred, the requester may initiate administrative review under Section 11.5.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A public body that discloses records in accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General is immune from all liabilities by reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under this Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) If the requester files suit under Section 11 with respect to the same denial that is the subject of a pending request for review, the requester shall notify the Public Access Counselor, and the Public Access Counselor shall take no further action with respect to the request for review and shall so notify the public body.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) The Attorney General may also issue advisory opinions to public bodies regarding compliance with this Act. A review may be initiated upon receipt of a written request from the head of the public body or its attorney, which shall contain sufficient accurate facts from which a determination can be made. The Public Access Counselor may request additional information from the public body in order to assist in the review. A public body that relies in good faith on an advisory opinion of the Attorney General in responding to a request is not liable for penalties under this Act, so long as the facts upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly disclosed to the Public Access Counselor.</p>\n   <p class=\"left\">(Source: P.A. 103-69, eff. 1-1-24.)</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

(a) Each public body shall make available to any person for inspection\nor copying all public records, except as otherwise provided in Sections 7 and\n8.5 of this Act. Notwithstanding any other law, a public body may not grant to\nany person or entity, whether by contract, license, or otherwise, the\nexclusive right to access and disseminate any public record as defined in this\nAct.\n\n(b) Subject to the fee provisions of Section 6 of this Act, each public body\nshall promptly provide, to any person who submits a request, a copy of any\npublic record required to be disclosed by subsection (a) of this Section and\nshall certify such copy if so requested.\n\n(c) Requests for inspection or copies shall be made in writing and directed to\nthe public body.

A public body\nmay not require that a request be submitted on a standard form or require the\nrequester to specify the purpose for a request, except to determine whether\nthe records are requested for a commercial purpose or whether to grant a\nrequest for a fee waiver. All requests for inspection and copying received by\na public body shall immediately be forwarded to its Freedom of Information\nofficer or designee.\n\n(d) Each public body shall, promptly, either comply with or deny a request for\npublic records within 5 business days after its receipt of the request, unless\nthe time for response is properly extended under subsection (e) of this\nSection. Denial shall be in writing as provided in Section 9 of this Act.\nFailure to comply with a written request, extend the time for response, or\ndeny a request within 5 business days after its receipt shall be considered a\ndenial of the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request within\nthe requisite periods in this Section but thereafter provides the requester\nwith copies of the requested public records may not impose a fee for such\ncopies. A public body that fails to respond to a request received may not\ntreat the request as unduly burdensome under subsection (g).\n\n(e) The time for response under this Section may be extended by the public\nbody for not more than 5 business days from the original due date for any of\nthe following reasons:\n\n(i) the requested records are stored in whole or in part at other locations\nthan the office having charge of the requested records;\n\n(ii) the request requires the collection of a substantial number of specified\nrecords;\n\n(iii) the request is couched in categorical terms and requires an extensive\nsearch for the records responsive to it;\n\n(iv) the requested records have not been located in the course of routine\nsearch and additional efforts are being made to locate them;\n\n(v) the requested records require examination and evaluation by personnel\nhaving the necessary competence and discretion to determine if they are exempt\nfrom disclosure under Section 7 of this Act or should be revealed only with\nappropriate deletions;\n\n(vi) the request for records cannot be complied with by the public body within\nthe time limits prescribed by subsection (d) of this Section without unduly\nburdening or interfering with the operations of the public body;\n\n(vii) there is a need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all\npracticable speed, with another public body or among 2 or more components of a\npublic body having a substantial interest in the determination or in the\nsubject matter of the request.\n\nThe person making a request and the public body may agree in writing to extend\nthe time for compliance for a period to be determined by the parties.

A public body that\nrequests an extension and subsequently fails to respond to the request may not\ntreat the request as unduly burdensome under subsection (g).\n\n(g) Requests calling for all records falling within a category shall be\ncomplied with unless compliance with the request would be unduly burdensome\nfor the complying public body and there is no way to narrow the request and\nthe burden on the public body outweighs the public interest in the\ninformation. Before invoking this exemption, the public body shall extend to\nthe person making the request an opportunity to confer with it in an attempt\nto reduce the request to manageable proportions. If any public body responds\nto a categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly burden its\noperation and the conditions described above are met, it shall do so in\nwriting, specifying the reasons why it would be unduly burdensome and the\nextent to which compliance will so burden the operations of the public body.\nSuch a response shall be treated as a denial of the request for information.\n\nRepeated requests from the same person for the same records that are unchanged\nor identical to records previously provided or properly denied under this Act\nshall be deemed unduly burdensome under this provision.\n\n(h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations in conformity with\nthe provisions of this Section pertaining to the availability of records and\nprocedures to be followed, including:\n\n(i) the times and places where such records will be made available, and\n\n(ii) the persons from whom such records may be obtained.\n\n(i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request to inspect or copy\nrecords set out in this Section shall not apply to _automated requests,_\nrequests for records made for a commercial purpose, requests by a recurrent\nrequester, or voluminous requests.

The person making a\nrequest and the public body may agree in writing to extend the time for\ncompliance for a period to be determined by the parties. If the requester and\nthe public body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by the\npublic body to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be treated as a\ndenial of the request for the records._\n\n_(e) If a requester does not pay a fee charged pursuant to Section 6 of this\nAct for an automated request, the debt shall be considered a debt due and\nowing to the public body and may be collected in accordance with applicable\nlaw. This fee may be charged by the public body even if the requester fails to\naccept or collect records the public body has prepared in response to an\nautomated request._\n\n(5 ILCS 140/6) (from Ch. 116, par. 206)\n\nSec. 6. Authority to charge fees.\n\n(a) When a person requests a copy of a record maintained in an electronic\nformat, the public body shall furnish it in the electronic format specified by\nthe requester, if feasible. If it is not feasible to furnish the public\nrecords in the specified electronic format, then the public body shall furnish\nit in the format in which it is maintained by the public body, or in paper\nformat at the option of the requester. A public body may charge the requester\nfor the actual cost of purchasing the recording medium, whether disc,\ndiskette, tape, or other medium. If a request is not _an automated request,_ a\nrequest for a commercial purpose _,_ or a voluminous request, a public body\nmay not charge the requester for the costs of any search for and review of the\nrecords or other personnel costs associated with reproducing the records.\nExcept to the extent that the General Assembly expressly provides, statutory\nfees applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a paper format\nshall not be applicable to those records when furnished in an electronic\nformat.\n\n(a-5) If a voluminous request is for electronic records and those records are\nnot in a portable document format (PDF), the public body may charge up to $20\nfor not more than 2 megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than 2 but not more\nthan 4 megabytes of data, and up to $100 for more than 4 megabytes of data.

If the responsive electronic records are in both a portable document\nformat and not in a portable document format, the public body may separate the\nfees and charge the requester under both fee scales.\n\nIf a public body imposes a fee pursuant to this subsection (a-5), it must\nprovide the requester with an accounting of all fees, costs, and personnel\nhours in connection with the request for public records.\n\n(b) Except when a fee is otherwise fixed by statute, each public body may\ncharge fees reasonably calculated to reimburse its actual cost for reproducing\nand certifying public records and for the use, by any person, of the equipment\nof the public body to copy records. No fees shall be charged for the first 50\npages of black and white, letter or legal sized copies requested by a\nrequester. The fee for black and white, letter or legal sized copies shall not\nexceed 15 cents per page. If a public body provides copies in color or in a\nsize other than letter or legal, the public body may not charge more than its\nactual cost for reproducing the records. In calculating its actual cost for\nreproducing records or for the use of the equipment of the public body to\nreproduce records, a public body shall not include the costs of any search for\nand review of the records or other personnel costs associated with reproducing\nthe records, except for commercial requests as provided in subsection (f) of\nthis Section. Such fees shall be imposed according to a standard scale of\nfees, established and made public by the body imposing them. The cost for\ncertifying a record shall not exceed $1.\n\n(c) Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge, as\ndetermined by the public body, if the person requesting the documents states\nthe specific purpose for the request and indicates that a waiver or reduction\nof the fee is in the public interest. Waiver or reduction of the fee is in the\npublic interest if the principal purpose of the request is to access and\ndisseminate information regarding the health, safety and welfare or the legal\nrights of the general public and is not for the principal purpose of personal\nor commercial benefit. For purposes of this subsection, \"commercial benefit\"\nshall not apply to requests made by news media when the principal purpose of\nthe request is to access and disseminate information regarding the health,\nsafety, and welfare or the legal rights of the general public. In setting the\namount of the waiver or reduction, the public body may take into consideration\nthe amount of materials requested and the cost of copying them.\n\n(d) The imposition of a fee not consistent with subsections (6)(a) and (b) of\nthis Act constitutes a denial of access to public records for the purposes of\njudicial review.\n\n(e) The fee for each abstract of a driver's record shall be as provided in\nSection 6-118 of \"The Illinois Vehicle Code\", approved September 29, 1969, as\namended, whether furnished as a paper copy or as an electronic copy.\n\n(f) A public body may charge up to $10 for each hour spent by personnel in\nsearching for and retrieving a requested record or examining the record for\nnecessary redactions. No fees shall be charged for the first 8 hours spent by\npersonnel in searching for or retrieving a requested record. A public body may\ncharge the actual cost of retrieving and transporting public records from an\noff-site storage facility when the public records are maintained by a third-\nparty storage company under contract with the public body. If a public body\nimposes a fee pursuant to this subsection (f), it must provide the requester\nwith an accounting of all fees, costs, and personnel hours in connection with\nthe request for public records. The provisions of this subsection (f) apply\nonly to commercial requests.\n\n(Source: P.A. 97-579, eff. 8-26-11; 98-1129, eff. 12-3-14.)\n\n(5 ILCS 140/9.5)\n\nSec. 9.5.
