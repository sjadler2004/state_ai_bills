(NRS 388.1335) <b>Section 1</b> of this bill requires each public school to publish on an Internet website maintained by the school and to provide at the school information relating to mental health and certain resources for caring for the mental health of pupils. <b>Section 1</b> also requires each public school to conduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the school year for the pupils of the school to provide education and information relating to mental health.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school psychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296) <b>Section 2</b> of this bill prohibits a public school from using artificial intelligence to perform the functions and duties of a school counselor, school psychologist or school social worker which relate to the mental health of pupils.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to attend public school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of trustees of a school district to prescribe a minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade. (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child from those attendance requirements when satisfactory written evidence, including a certificate from certain providers of health care, is presented to the board of trustees of the school district in which the child resides that the child&rsquo;s physical or mental condition or behavioral health is such as to prevent or render inadvisable the child&rsquo;s attendance at school or his or her application to study. (NRS 392.050) <b>Section 3</b> of this bill additionally excuses a child from attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately following any date or dates to which a certificate from a provider of health care applies.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the approval of a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent: (1) because the pupil is physically or mentally unable to attend school; or (2) for the observance of a religious holiday. (NRS 391.130) A day on which a pupil is absent for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as approved, with certain exceptions; and (2) credited towards the minimum number of days that a pupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122, 392.130) <b>Section 6</b> of this bill provides that a pupil is not a truant if the pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement of the death of an immediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing distress relating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health reasons. <b>Section 6</b> requires the parent or legal guardian or other person having control or charge of a pupil who is absent from school for those reasons to notify the teacher or principal of the school within 3 days after the absence. <b>Section 6</b> then deems those absences as approved, except that only a certain amount of absences for each reason may be approved within 1 school year. <b>Section 5</b> of this bill requires those days on which the pupil was absent under those circumstances to be credited towards the minimum number of days that the pupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed course-work requirements. <b>Section 4</b> of this bill provides that an absence that is approved under those circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is required to indicate on a report card issued to a pupil.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Section 5</b> prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a pupil to the next higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the minimum number of days required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a weighted 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 grading scale, for the school year; and (2) the absences, without which would otherwise allow the pupil to receive credit or be promoted to the next grade, were caused by or relate to bullying or physical, mental or behavioral health.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage and family therapists, clinical professional counselors, registered nurses, social workers, alcohol and drug counselors and problem gambling counselors; and (2) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in the practices of those professions. (Chapters 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) <b>Section 7</b> of this bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider from offering to users in this State an artificial intelligence system that is specifically programmed to provide a user with a service or an experience that would constitute the practice of professional mental or behavioral health care if provided by a natural person. <b>Section 7</b> also prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a natural person who is not licensed to practice professional mental or behavioral health care from making certain representations that would lead a person to believe that the provider, the artificial intelligence system operated by the provider or the natural person is capable of or qualified to provide mental or behavioral health care. <b>Section 8</b> of this bill imposes certain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an artificial intelligence system by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.</p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"center\">THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Section 1.</b> NRS 388.1335 is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">388.1335 1. <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Each public school, including, without limitation, a charter school or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, shall publish on an Internet website maintained by the school and provide in a conspicuous and accessible location at the school information relating to mental health, including, without limitation:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) Information about any counseling or other mental health services that are available to pupils at the school, including, without limitation, services provided by the school and services available in the community where the school is located; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Information relating to resources and services for crisis intervention, including, without limitation, information about the hotline described in NRS 433.704 for persons who are considering suicide or otherwise in a behavioral health crisis.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">2.

(BDR 34-674)\n\nFISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.\n\nEffect on the State: Yes.\n\nAN ACT relating to health; requiring a public school to provide certain\ninformation relating to mental health to pupils; prohibiting certain uses of\nartificial intelligence in public schools; requiring that a pupil be allowed\ncredit or promotion to the next higher grade despite absences from school in\ncertain circumstances; deeming certain absences from school to be approved\nabsences; imposing certain restrictions relating to the marketing and\nprogramming of artificial intelligence systems; prohibiting certain persons\nfrom representing themselves as qualified to provide mental or behavioral\nhealth care; imposing certain restrictions relating to the use of artificial\nintelligence by providers of mental or behavioral health care; providing civil\npenalties; and providing other matters properly relating thereto.\n\n**Legislative Counsel 's Digest:**\n\nExisting law requires the board of trustees of a school district or governing\nbody of a charter school to ensure that information relating to mental health\nresources appears on the back of any identification card issued to a pupil at\na school within the school district or the charter school. (NRS 388.1335)\n**Section 1** of this bill requires each public school to publish on an\nInternet website maintained by the school and to provide at the school\ninformation relating to mental health and certain resources for caring for the\nmental health of pupils. **Section 1** also requires each public school to\nconduct a live assembly at least once every 3 months during the school year\nfor the pupils of the school to provide education and information relating to\nmental health.\n\nExisting law prescribes the authority and duties of a school counselor, school\npsychologist and school social worker. (NRS 391.293, 391.294, 391.296)\n**Section 2** of this bill prohibits a public school from using artificial\nintelligence to perform the functions and duties of a school counselor, school\npsychologist or school social worker which relate to the mental health of\npupils.\n\nExisting law, in general, requires a child between 6 and 18 years of age to\nattend public school. (NRS 392.040) Existing law requires the board of\ntrustees of a school district to prescribe a minimum number of days that a\npupil must be in attendance for the pupil to obtain credit or be promoted to\nthe next higher grade. (NRS 392.122) Existing law excuses a child from those\nattendance requirements when satisfactory written evidence, including a\ncertificate from certain providers of health care, is presented to the board\nof trustees of the school district in which the child resides that the child's\nphysical or mental condition or behavioral health is such as to prevent or\nrender inadvisable the child's attendance at school or his or her application\nto study. (NRS 392.050) **Section 3** of this bill additionally excuses a\nchild from attendance for the dates immediately preceding and immediately\nfollowing any date or dates to which a certificate from a provider of health\ncare applies.\n\nExisting law deems as a truant a pupil who is absent from school without the\napproval of a teacher or principal of the school, unless the pupil is absent:\n(1) because the pupil is physically or mentally unable to attend school; or\n(2) for the observance of a religious holiday. (NRS 391.130) A day on which a\npupil is absent for those reasons must be: (1) deemed as approved, with\ncertain exceptions; and (2) credited towards the minimum number of days that a\npupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted to the next higher\ngrade, if the pupil has completed course-work requirements. (NRS 392.122,\n392.130) **Section 6** of this bill provides that a pupil is not a truant if\nthe pupil is absent from school: (1) for the bereavement of the death of an\nimmediate family member; (2) because the pupil is experiencing distress\nrelating to bullying; or (3) for certain other mental or behavioral health\nreasons. **Section 6** requires the parent or legal guardian or other person\nhaving control or charge of a pupil who is absent from school for those\nreasons to notify the teacher or principal of the school within 3 days after\nthe absence. **Section 6** then deems those absences as approved, except that\nonly a certain amount of absences for each reason may be approved within 1\nschool year. **Section 5** of this bill requires those days on which the pupil\nwas absent under those circumstances to be credited towards the minimum number\nof days that the pupil must be in attendance to obtain credit or be promoted\nto the next higher grade, if the pupil has completed course-work requirements.\n**Section 4** of this bill provides that an absence that is approved under\nthose circumstances is not considered an absence that a school is required to\nindicate on a report card issued to a pupil.\n\n**Section 5** prohibits the denial of credit to a pupil or the promotion of a\npupil to the next higher grade because the pupil did not attend school for the\nminimum number of days required if: (1) the pupil has earned at least a\nweighted 3.0 grade point average, on a 4.0 grading scale, for the school year;\nand (2) the absences, without which would otherwise allow the pupil to receive\ncredit or be promoted to the next grade, were caused by or relate to bullying\nor physical, mental or behavioral health.\n\nExisting law: (1) regulates the practice and requires the licensure of certain\nmental health professionals, including psychiatrists, psychologists, marriage\nand family therapists, clinical professional counselors, registered nurses,\nsocial workers, alcohol and drug counselors and problem gambling counselors;\nand (2) prohibits unlicensed persons from engaging in the practices of those\nprofessions. (Chapters 630, 632, 633 and 641-641C of NRS) **Section 7** of\nthis bill prohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence\nprovider from offering to users in this State an artificial intelligence\nsystem that is specifically programmed to provide a user with a service or an\nexperience that would constitute the practice of professional mental or\nbehavioral health care if provided by a natural person. **Section 7** also\nprohibits, with certain exceptions, an artificial intelligence provider or a\nnatural person who is not licensed to practice professional mental or\nbehavioral health care from making certain representations that would lead a\nperson to believe that the provider, the artificial intelligence system\noperated by the provider or the natural person is capable of or qualified to\nprovide mental or behavioral health care. **Section 8** of this bill imposes\ncertain restrictions and prohibitions on the use of an artificial intelligence\nsystem by a licensed provider of mental and behavioral health care.\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO\nENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n**Section 1.** NRS 388.1335 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n388.1335 1. _Each public school, including, without limitation, a charter\nschool or university school for profoundly gifted pupils, shall publish on an\nInternet website maintained by the school and provide in a conspicuous and\naccessible location at the school information relating to mental health,\nincluding, without limitation:_\n\n_(a) Information about any counseling or other mental health services that are\navailable to pupils at the school, including, without limitation, services\nprovided by the school and services available in the community where the\nschool is located; and_\n\n_(b) Information relating to resources and services for crisis intervention,\nincluding, without limitation, information about the hotline described in NRS\n433.704 for persons who are considering suicide or otherwise in a behavioral\nhealth crisis._\n\n_2\\.
