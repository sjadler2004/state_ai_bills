The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington&#39;s existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2.

The legislature finds that rapid advancements in\nartificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily\ncreate or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread\nproliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable\nfrom authentic images.\n\nThe legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been\nreported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation,\nand that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly\ncapable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit\nconduct.\n\nThe legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital\ntools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of\ncrimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\nincluding by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse\nmaterial available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child\nsexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting\nconventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.\n\nThe legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a\nminor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable\nvictim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and\nviewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of\nhealthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future\nvictimization.\n\nThe legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest\nin preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even\nfabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be\nregulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.\n\nTherefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing\nprohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually\nexplicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not\nidentifiable.\n\nSec. 2. RCW _9.68A.011_ and 2024 c 88 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to\nread as follows:\n\nUnless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the definitions in this\nsection apply throughout this chapter.\n\n(1) \"Digitization\" means creating or altering any visual or printed matter to\ndepict ~~an identifiable~~ _a_ minor in a realistic manner utilizing images of\nanother person or computer-generated images, regardless of whether such\ncreation or alteration is accomplished manually or through an automated\nprocess. \"Digitization\" includes, but is not limited to, creation or\nalteration of any visual or printed matter by using artificial intelligence.\n\n(2) \"Fabricated ~~depiction of an identifiable minor \" and \"fabricated\ndepiction\" mean~~ _depiction \" means_ any visual or printed matter that\n~~depicts~~ _was created or altered by digitization to depict_ a minor ~~who\nis identifiable from the matter itself or from information displayed with or\notherwise connected to the matter, and that was created or altered by\ndigitization to depict the minor~~ engaging in sexually explicit conduct ~~in\nwhich the minor did not actually engage~~ _, and that is obscene_.\n\n(3) An \"internet session\" means a period of time during which an internet\nuser, using a specific internet protocol address, visits or is logged into an\ninternet site for an uninterrupted period of time.\n\n(4) \"Live performance\" means any play, show, skit, dance, or other exhibition\nperformed or presented to or before an audience of one or more, with or\nwithout consideration.\n\n(5) \"Minor\" means any person under ~~eighteen~~ _18_ years of age.\n\n(6) _\" Obscene\" shall have and include all those meanings which are assigned\nto it under the common law._\n\n_(7)_ To \"photograph\" means to make a print, negative, slide, digital image,\nmotion picture, or videotape.

The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington&#39;s existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2.

The legislature finds that rapid advancements in\nartificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily\ncreate or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread\nproliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable\nfrom authentic images.\n\nThe legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been\nreported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation,\nand that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly\ncapable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit\nconduct.\n\nThe legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital\ntools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of\ncrimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\nincluding by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse\nmaterial available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child\nsexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting\nconventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.\n\nThe legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a\nminor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable\nvictim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and\nviewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of\nhealthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future\nvictimization.\n\nThe legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest\nin preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even\nfabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be\nregulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.\n\nTherefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing\nprohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually\nexplicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not\nidentifiable.\n\nSec. 2. RCW _9.68A.011_ and 2024 c 88 s 1 are each reenacted and amended to\nread as follows:\n\nUnless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the definitions in this\nsection apply throughout this chapter.\n\n(1) \"Digitization\" means creating or altering any visual or printed matter to\ndepict ~~an identifiable~~ _a_ minor in a realistic manner utilizing images of\nanother person or computer-generated images, regardless of whether such\ncreation or alteration is accomplished manually or through an automated\nprocess. \"Digitization\" includes, but is not limited to, creation or\nalteration of any visual or printed matter by using artificial intelligence.\n\n(2) \"Fabricated ~~depiction of an identifiable minor \" and \"fabricated\ndepiction\" mean~~ _depiction \" means_ any visual or printed matter that\n~~depicts~~ _was created or altered by digitization to depict_ a minor ~~who\nis identifiable from the matter itself or from information displayed with or\notherwise connected to the matter, and that was created or altered by\ndigitization to depict the minor~~ engaging in sexually explicit conduct ~~in\nwhich the minor did not actually engage~~ _, and that is obscene_.\n\n(3) An \"internet session\" means a period of time during which an internet\nuser, using a specific internet protocol address, visits or is logged into an\ninternet site for an uninterrupted period of time.\n\n(4) \"Live performance\" means any play, show, skit, dance, or other exhibition\nperformed or presented to or before an audience of one or more, with or\nwithout consideration.\n\n(5) \"Minor\" means any person under ~~eighteen~~ _18_ years of age.\n\n(6) _\" Obscene\" shall have and include all those meanings which are assigned\nto it under the common law._\n\n_(7)_ To \"photograph\" means to make a print, negative, slide, digital image,\nmotion picture, or videotape. A \"photograph\" means anything tangible or\nintangible produced by photographing.\n\n~~(7)~~ _(8)_ \"Sexually explicit conduct\" means actual or simulated:\n\n(a) Sexual intercourse, including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital,\nor oral-anal, whether between persons of the same or opposite sex or between\nhumans and animals;\n\n(b) Penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object;\n\n(c) Masturbation;\n\n(d) Sadomasochistic abuse;\n\n(e) Defecation or urination for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the\nviewer;\n\n(f) Depiction of the genitals or unclothed pubic or rectal areas of any minor,\nor the unclothed breast of a female minor, for the purpose of sexual\nstimulation of the viewer. For the purposes of this subsection ~~(7)~~\n_(8)_(f), it is not necessary that the minor know that he or she is\nparticipating in the described conduct, or any aspect of it; and\n\n(g) Touching of a person's clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area,\nbuttocks, or breast area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.\n\n~~(8)~~ _(9)_ \"Visual or printed matter\" means any photograph or other\nmaterial that contains a reproduction of a photograph. \"Visual or printed\nmatter\" includes, but is not limited to, any such photograph or other material\nthat constitutes a fabricated depiction ~~of an identifiable minor~~.\n\nSec. 3.
