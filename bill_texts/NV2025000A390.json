(Chapter 288 of NRS) **Sections\n13-35 and 43-47, 49 and 50** of this bill expand the powers and duties of the\nBoard to include various powers and duties relating to collective bargaining\nbetween task workers and providers. **Sections 41, 48 and 49** of this bill\nchange the name of the Board to the Labor Relations Board to conform to this\nchange in powers and duties.\n\n**Section 15** sets forth certain prohibited practices for task delivery\nplatform providers and task worker organizations, including, among others, the\nrefusal to collectively bargain in good faith concerning the compensation,\nhours, procedures for the adjustment of grievances and other terms and\nconditions of work. **Section 16** sets forth procedures for the Board to hear\nand decide complaints alleging that a party committed such a prohibited\npractice.\n\n**Section 17** requires each provider to submit certain quarterly reports to\nthe Board concerning the task workers with whom the provider has contracted.\n**Section 17** additionally requires the Board to maintain a list of each\nactive task worker based on the information provided in such reports.\n\n**Section 18** requires the Board to establish by regulation industry-wide\nbargaining units consisting of groups of task workers who have a sufficient\ncommunity of interest appropriate for representation by a task worker\norganization for the purpose of collective bargaining.\n\n**Section 19** sets forth procedures by which a task worker organization may\nbe designated as a recognized bargaining representative of a bargaining unit\nby the Board. **Sections 20 and 21** set forth procedures by which a task\nworker organization may be certified as the exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative for a bargaining unit. **Section 23** provides that a task\nworker organization that has been certified as an exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative remains the exclusive bargaining representative until replaced\nor decertified in accordance with the procedures set forth in **sections 23\nand 29.
