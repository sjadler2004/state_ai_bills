For the purpose of this section, the present value of the aggregate debt service of the refunding or repayment bonds, notes or other obligations and the aggregate debt service of the bonds, notes or other obligations refunded or repaid shall be calculated by utilizing the effective interest rate of the refunding or repayment of bonds, notes or other obligations, which shall be that rate arrived at by doubling the semi-annual interest rate (compounded semi-annually) necessary to discount the debt service payments on the refunding or repayment of bonds, notes or other obligations from payment of dates thereof to the date of issue of the refunding or repayment of bonds, notes or other obligations and to the price bid including estimated accrued interest from the sale thereof.

During the phase-in period of subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph, if a nonpublic school meets the criteria in subparagraph (iii) of\nparagraph (a) of this subdivision with respect to provisional status then all\naffiliated schools shall be deemed to have met such criteria. If a nonpublic\nhigh school meets the criteria in subparagraph (i) or (vi) of paragraph (a) of\nthis subdivision, then all affiliated middle or elementary schools shall be\ndeemed to have met such criteria._\n\n_(c) Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the commissioner from defining\nby rule or regulation alternative criteria which may also be used to\ndemonstrate that instruction at a nonpublic school is in compliance with this\nsection. Compliance with this section may be demonstrated through any one or\nmore of the criteria established in this subdivision and shall thereby qualify\nas and be finally recognized to be substantially equivalent without any\nfurther requirements. A nonpublic school 's satisfaction of one or more\ncriteria in one school year shall not automatically be deemed satisfaction of\nsuch criteria in later school years if such school ceases to satisfy such\ncriteria in such later years. A nonpublic school may elect at any time to\nselect different criteria. A nonpublic school's omission to satisfy one or\nmore criteria shall not affect a nonpublic school's ability to satisfy another\ncriteria, or such criteria at a later date._\n\nSection 23.

Subdivisions 1, 3 and 4 of section 245.50 of the criminal procedure\nlaw, subdivisions 1 and 3 as amended by section 7 of part HHH of chapter 56 of\nthe laws of 2020 and subdivision 4 as amended by section 1 of subpart D of\npart UU of chapter 56 of the laws of 2022, are amended and two new\nsubdivisions 5 and 6 are added to read as follows:\n\n1\\. By the prosecution. When the prosecution has ~~provided~~ _, pursuant to\nthis section, exercised due diligence and acted in good faith in making\nreasonable inquiries and efforts to obtain and provide_ the discovery required\nby subdivision one of section 245.20 of this article, except for discovery\nthat is lost or destroyed as provided by paragraph (b) of subdivision one of\nsection 245.80 of this article and except for any ~~items~~ _material_ or\ninformation that ~~are~~ _is_ the subject of an order pursuant to section\n245.70 of this article, it shall serve upon the defendant and file with the\ncourt a certificate of compliance. The certificate of compliance shall state\nthat, after exercising due diligence and making reasonable inquiries _and\nefforts_ to ascertain the existence of _, obtain, and disclose_ material and\ninformation subject to discovery, the ~~prosecutor~~ _prosecution_ has\ndisclosed and made available all known material and information _it has\nobtained_ subject to discovery. It shall also identify the items provided.\n~~If additional discovery is subsequently provided~~ _The prosecution shall\nalso identify the items that the prosecution is required to disclose and of\nwhich the prosecution is aware, but has been unable to obtain despite the\nexercise of due diligence as evaluated under this section. If the prosecution\nprovides additional discovery_ prior to trial pursuant to section 245.60 of\nthis article, a supplemental certificate shall be served upon the defendant\nand filed with the court identifying the additional material and information\nprovided. No adverse consequence to the prosecution or the prosecutor shall\nresult from the filing of a certificate of compliance in good faith and\nreasonable under the circumstances; but the court may grant a remedy or\nsanction for a discovery violation as provided in section 245.80 of this\narticle. _The filing of a supplemental certificate of compliance shall not\nimpact the validity of the original certificate of compliance if filed in good\nfaith and after exercising due diligence as assessed under this section._\n\n3\\. Trial readiness. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, absent\nan individualized finding of special circumstances in the instant case by the\ncourt before which the charge is pending, the prosecution shall not be deemed\nready for trial for purposes of section 30.30 of this chapter until it has\nfiled a ~~proper~~ _valid_ certificate pursuant to subdivision one of this\nsection. A court may deem the prosecution ready for trial pursuant to section\n30.30 of this chapter where information that might be considered discoverable\nunder this article cannot be disclosed because it has been lost, destroyed, or\notherwise unavailable as provided by paragraph (b) of subdivision one of\nsection 245.80 of this article, despite diligent and good faith efforts,\nreasonable under the circumstances. Provided, however, that the court may\ngrant a remedy or sanction for a discovery violation as provided by section\n245.80 of this article.\n\n4\\. _Challenges._ (a) Challenges to, or questions related to a certificate of\ncompliance shall be addressed by motion.\n\n(b) To the extent that the party is aware of a potential defect or deficiency\nrelated to a certificate of compliance or supplemental certificate of\ncompliance, the party entitled to disclosure shall notify or alert the\nopposing party ~~as soon as practicable~~ _in accordance with the procedure\nset forth in this subdivision_.\n\n(c) Challenges ~~related to the sufficiency~~ _to the validity_ of a\ncertificate of compliance or supplemental certificates of compliance _served\non the defense and filed with the court pursuant to subdivision one of this\nsection_ shall be addressed by motion ~~as soon as practicable, provided that\nnothing in this section shall be construed to waive a party 's right to make\nfurther challenges, including but not limited to a motion pursuant to section\n30.30 of this chapter~~ _within thirty-five days of the service of the\ncertificate provided that the prosecution has filed an indictment or\ninformation prior to filing the certificate of compliance. Nothing in this\nsection shall be construed to waive a party 's right to file a motion pursuant\nto section 30.30 of this chapter on grounds unrelated to the validity of a\ncertificate of compliance. Provided, however, that any challenges to a\ncertificate of compliance or supplemental certificate of compliance shall be\naccompanied by an affirmation by the moving party that, after the filing of\nthe opposing party's certificate of compliance, such moving party timely\nconferred in good faith or timely made good faith efforts to confer with the\nopposing party regarding the specific and particularized matters forming the\nbasis for such challenge, that efforts to obtain the missing discovery from\nthe opposing party or otherwise resolve the issues raised were unsuccessful,\nand that no accommodation could be reached. For the purposes of this\nsubdivision, the parties may confer informally, including but not limited to\ncommunication by email, telephone, or any other reasonable means._\n\n_(i) Upon request, the court may extend the time period to challenge a\ncertificate of compliance or supplemental certificate of compliance beyond the\nthirty-five days for good cause shown. A request for extension shall be made\nbefore the expiration of the thirty-five days. Unless the court finds that the\nprosecutor unreasonably delayed in responding to the defense 's good faith\nefforts to confer or that the prosecutor did not file the certificate of\ncompliance in good faith, any such extension shall be excluded from a speedy\ntrial calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section\n30.30 of this chapter._\n\n_(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, a party may\nchallenge the validity of the certificate of compliance after the expiration\nof the thirty-five day period where the grounds for such challenge are based\nupon a material change in circumstances, including but not limited to the\nbelated disclosure of discoverable material pursuant to section 245.20 of this\narticle, or, where the party entitled to disclosure could not, with due\ndiligence, have known of the specific and particularized matters forming the\nbasis of the challenge prior to the expiration of such period._\n\n_(iii) Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the court 's authority to\nfacilitate compliance pursuant to section 245.35 of this article. Any\nextension of time granted pursuant to section 245.35 shall be excluded from a\nspeedy trial calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision four of\nsection 30.30 of this chapter._\n\n_5\\. Assessing due diligence. In assessing a party 's due diligence, the court\nshall look at the totality of the party's efforts to comply with the\nprovisions of this article, rather than assess the party's efforts item by\nitem._\n\n_(a) Relevant factors for assessing the prosecutor 's due diligence include,\nbut are not limited to: the efforts made by the prosecutor to comply with the\nrequirements of this article; the volume of discovery provided and the volume\nof discovery outstanding; the complexity of the case; whether the prosecutor\nknew that the belatedly disclosed or allegedly missing material existed; the\nexplanation for any alleged discovery lapse; the prosecutor's response when\napprised of any allegedly missing discovery; whether the belated discovery was\nsubstantively duplicative, insignificant, or easily remedied; whether the\nomission was corrected; whether the prosecution self-reported the error and\ntook prompt remedial action without court intervention; and whether the\nprosecution's delayed disclosure of discovery was prejudicial to the defense\nor otherwise impeded the defense's ability to effectively investigate the case\nor prepare for trial._\n\n_(b) The court 's determination shall be based on consideration of all factors\nlisted in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and no one factor shall be\ndeterminative. The court shall explain the basis for its determination on the\nrecord or in writing._\n\n_(c) A finding of a valid certificate under this section shall constitute a\nvalid certificate pursuant to subdivision five of section 30.30 of this\nchapter. Upon a finding of a valid certificate, the court shall, if warranted,\nfashion an appropriate and proportional remedy for any discovery violation\nresulting from the belated disclosure pursuant to subdivision two of section\n245.80 of this article._\n\n_6\\. Determinations by the court. Notwithstanding any other section of law to\nthe contrary, a court shall not invalidate a certificate of compliance where\nthe party has exercised due diligence and acted in good faith in making\nreasonable inquiries and efforts to obtain and provide the material required\nto be disclosed pursuant to section 245.20 of this article._\n\nSection 5. The criminal procedure law is amended by adding a new section\n245.90 to read as follows:\n\n_Section 245.90 Federal and state constitutional obligations._\n\n_Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the people 's obligations\nto comply with federal and state constitutional law._\n\nSection 6. Subdivision 5 of section 30.30 of the criminal procedure law, as\namended by section 1 of part KKK of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended\nto read as follows:\n\n5\\. _(a)_ Whenever pursuant to this section a prosecutor states or otherwise\nprovides notice that the people are ready for trial, the court shall make\ninquiry on the record as to their actual readiness. If, after conducting its\ninquiry, the court determines that the people are not ready to proceed to\ntrial, the prosecutor's statement or notice of readiness shall not be valid\nfor purposes of this section. ~~Any statement of trial readiness must be\naccompanied or preceded by a certification of good faith compliance with the\ndisclosure requirements of section 245.20 of this chapter and the defense\nshall be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the record as to whether the\ndisclosure requirements have been met.~~ _The court may deem the people not\nready for trial based on the people 's failure to comply with the provisions\nof article two hundred forty-five of this chapter only if it finds that the\npeople's certificate of compliance that accompanied or preceded the people's\nstatement of readiness at issue was invalid under section 245.50 of this\nchapter._\n\n_(b) Pursuant to section 245.50 of this chapter, the certificate of compliance\nis deemed invalid when the court determined that the people did not exercise\ndue diligence and, in making such determination, the court looked at the\ntotality of the prosecution 's efforts to comply with the provisions of\narticle two hundred forty-five of this chapter, rather than assess the\nprosecution's efforts item by item, and considered the factors relevant to\nassessing due diligence, which include, but are not limited to: the efforts\nmade by the prosecutor to comply with the requirements of article two hundred\nforty-five of this chapter; the volume of discovery provided and the volume of\ndiscovery outstanding; the complexity of the case; whether the prosecutor knew\nthat the belatedly disclosed or allegedly missing material existed; the\nexplanation for any alleged discovery lapse; the prosecutor's response when\napprised of any allegedly missing discovery; whether the belated discovery was\nsubstantively duplicative, insignificant, or easily remedied; whether the\nomission was corrected; whether the prosecution self-reported the error and\ntook prompt remedial action without court intervention; and whether the\nprosecution's delayed disclosure of discovery was prejudicial to the defense\nor otherwise impeded the defense's ability to effectively investigate the case\nor prepare for trial._\n\nSection 7. Section 245.70 of the criminal procedure law is amended by adding a\nnew subdivision 8 to read as follows:\n\n_8\\. A motion filed in good faith pursuant to subdivision one or two of this\nsection shall be deemed a pre-trial motion for the purposes of paragraph (a)\nof subdivision four of section 30.30 of this chapter._\n\nSection 8. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law and shall apply to all criminal actions pending on such date and\nall actions commenced on or after such date. Any timeframes provided in this\nact regarding the time limitation to challenge a certificate of compliance\nshall run from the effective date of this act.\n\nPART MM\n\nSection 1.

A nonpublic school 's satisfaction of one or more\ncriteria in one school year shall not automatically be deemed satisfaction of\nsuch criteria in later school years if such school ceases to satisfy such\ncriteria in such later years. A nonpublic school may elect at any time to\nselect different criteria.

Unless the court finds that the\nprosecutor unreasonably delayed in responding to the defense 's good faith\nefforts to confer or that the prosecutor did not file the certificate of\ncompliance in good faith, any such extension shall be excluded from a speedy\ntrial calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section\n30.30 of this chapter._\n\n_(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, a party may\nchallenge the validity of the certificate of compliance after the expiration\nof the thirty-five day period where the grounds for such challenge are based\nupon a material change in circumstances, including but not limited to the\nbelated disclosure of discoverable material pursuant to section 245.20 of this\narticle, or, where the party entitled to disclosure could not, with due\ndiligence, have known of the specific and particularized matters forming the\nbasis of the challenge prior to the expiration of such period._\n\n_(iii) Nothing in this subdivision shall limit the court 's authority to\nfacilitate compliance pursuant to section 245.35 of this article. Any\nextension of time granted pursuant to section 245.35 shall be excluded from a\nspeedy trial calculation pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision four of\nsection 30.30 of this chapter._\n\n_5\\. Assessing due diligence. In assessing a party 's due diligence, the court\nshall look at the totality of the party's efforts to comply with the\nprovisions of this article, rather than assess the party's efforts item by\nitem._\n\n_(a) Relevant factors for assessing the prosecutor 's due diligence include,\nbut are not limited to: the efforts made by the prosecutor to comply with the\nrequirements of this article; the volume of discovery provided and the volume\nof discovery outstanding; the complexity of the case; whether the prosecutor\nknew that the belatedly disclosed or allegedly missing material existed; the\nexplanation for any alleged discovery lapse; the prosecutor's response when\napprised of any allegedly missing discovery; whether the belated discovery was\nsubstantively duplicative, insignificant, or easily remedied; whether the\nomission was corrected; whether the prosecution self-reported the error and\ntook prompt remedial action without court intervention; and whether the\nprosecution's delayed disclosure of discovery was prejudicial to the defense\nor otherwise impeded the defense's ability to effectively investigate the case\nor prepare for trial._\n\n_(b) The court 's determination shall be based on consideration of all factors\nlisted in paragraph (a) of this subdivision and no one factor shall be\ndeterminative. The court shall explain the basis for its determination on the\nrecord or in writing._\n\n_(c) A finding of a valid certificate under this section shall constitute a\nvalid certificate pursuant to subdivision five of section 30.30 of this\nchapter. Upon a finding of a valid certificate, the court shall, if warranted,\nfashion an appropriate and proportional remedy for any discovery violation\nresulting from the belated disclosure pursuant to subdivision two of section\n245.80 of this article._\n\n_6\\. Determinations by the court. Notwithstanding any other section of law to\nthe contrary, a court shall not invalidate a certificate of compliance where\nthe party has exercised due diligence and acted in good faith in making\nreasonable inquiries and efforts to obtain and provide the material required\nto be disclosed pursuant to section 245.20 of this article._\n\nSection 5. The criminal procedure law is amended by adding a new section\n245.90 to read as follows:\n\n_Section 245.90 Federal and state constitutional obligations._\n\n_Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the people 's obligations\nto comply with federal and state constitutional law._\n\nSection 6. Subdivision 5 of section 30.30 of the criminal procedure law, as\namended by section 1 of part KKK of chapter 59 of the laws of 2019, is amended\nto read as follows:\n\n5\\. _(a)_ Whenever pursuant to this section a prosecutor states or otherwise\nprovides notice that the people are ready for trial, the court shall make\ninquiry on the record as to their actual readiness. If, after conducting its\ninquiry, the court determines that the people are not ready to proceed to\ntrial, the prosecutor's statement or notice of readiness shall not be valid\nfor purposes of this section. ~~Any statement of trial readiness must be\naccompanied or preceded by a certification of good faith compliance with the\ndisclosure requirements of section 245.20 of this chapter and the defense\nshall be afforded an opportunity to be heard on the record as to whether the\ndisclosure requirements have been met.~~ _The court may deem the people not\nready for trial based on the people 's failure to comply with the provisions\nof article two hundred forty-five of this chapter only if it finds that the\npeople's certificate of compliance that accompanied or preceded the people's\nstatement of readiness at issue was invalid under section 245.50 of this\nchapter._\n\n_(b) Pursuant to section 245.50 of this chapter, the certificate of compliance\nis deemed invalid when the court determined that the people did not exercise\ndue diligence and, in making such determination, the court looked at the\ntotality of the prosecution 's efforts to comply with the provisions of\narticle two hundred forty-five of this chapter, rather than assess the\nprosecution's efforts item by item, and considered the factors relevant to\nassessing due diligence, which include, but are not limited to: the efforts\nmade by the prosecutor to comply with the requirements of article two hundred\nforty-five of this chapter; the volume of discovery provided and the volume of\ndiscovery outstanding; the complexity of the case; whether the prosecutor knew\nthat the belatedly disclosed or allegedly missing material existed; the\nexplanation for any alleged discovery lapse; the prosecutor's response when\napprised of any allegedly missing discovery; whether the belated discovery was\nsubstantively duplicative, insignificant, or easily remedied; whether the\nomission was corrected; whether the prosecution self-reported the error and\ntook prompt remedial action without court intervention; and whether the\nprosecution's delayed disclosure of discovery was prejudicial to the defense\nor otherwise impeded the defense's ability to effectively investigate the case\nor prepare for trial._\n\nSection 7. Section 245.70 of the criminal procedure law is amended by adding a\nnew subdivision 8 to read as follows:\n\n_8\\. A motion filed in good faith pursuant to subdivision one or two of this\nsection shall be deemed a pre-trial motion for the purposes of paragraph (a)\nof subdivision four of section 30.30 of this chapter._\n\nSection 8. This act shall take effect on the ninetieth day after it shall have\nbecome a law and shall apply to all criminal actions pending on such date and\nall actions commenced on or after such date. Any timeframes provided in this\nact regarding the time limitation to challenge a certificate of compliance\nshall run from the effective date of this act.\n\nPART MM\n\nSection 1.
