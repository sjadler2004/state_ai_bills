(1) The legislature finds that health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers for the type and level of care covered for an enrollee&#39;s health care benefits and are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee&#39;s diagnosis or treatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how decisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly utilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or aid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended treatment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior authorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure licensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for making determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and services that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence tools are used to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to ensure these tools are not used to make inappropriate determinations that could impact the health of an enrollee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. RCW <u>48.43.830</u> and 2023 c 382 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior authorization for health care services and prescription drugs:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior authorization process, as designated by each carrier:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through a process other than an electronic prior authorization process:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination.

If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier&#39;s request for additional information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The carrier&#39;s prior authorization requirements must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be based on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria must be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging information related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect to black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved populations.

Beginning August 1, 2025, these adjustments can only be made once annually and go into effect January 1st of any given calendar year. Notification of policy changes must be provided to all in-network providers at least four months prior to the January 1st effective date.

(1) The legislature finds that health insurance\ncarriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers\nfor the type and level of care covered for an enrollee's health care benefits\nand are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee's diagnosis or\ntreatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how\ndecisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment,\nprescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly\nutilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or\naid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended\ntreatment.\n\n(2) It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior\nauthorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure\nlicensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for\nmaking determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and\nservices that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence tools are\nused to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to\nensure these tools are not used to make inappropriate determinations that\ncould impact the health of an enrollee.\n\nSec. 2. RCW _48.43.830_ and 2023 c 382 s 1 are each amended to read as\nfollows:\n\n(1) Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January\n1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior\nauthorization for health care services and prescription drugs:\n\n(a) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization\ndeterminations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that\nsubmits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior\nauthorization process, as designated by each carrier:\n\n(i) For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an\nelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that\ncontains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient\ninformation has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier\nshall request any additional information from the provider or facility within\none calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.\n\n(ii) For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day\nof submission of the electronic prior authorization request.\n\n(b) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization\ndeterminations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that\nsubmits the prior authorization request through a process other than an\nelectronic prior authorization process:\n\n(i) For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days\nof submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.\n\n(ii) For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier\nshall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of\nthe decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day\nof submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.\n\n(c) In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or\nfacility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination\nunder (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific\nreasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time\nframe must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier's\nrequest for additional information.\n\n(d) The carrier's prior authorization requirements must be described in detail\nand written in easily understandable language.

The\npeer reviewer provided by the carrier must possess a current and valid\nnonrestricted license to practice medicine in Washington state and must be\nknowledgeable of and have experience providing the same or similar service as\nthe health care service under review, and must have authority to modify or\noverturn the care determination decision._\n\n_(2) Carriers maintain the ability to make adjustments to policies and\nprocedures that impact the applicability of their prior authorization\nrequirements. Beginning August 1, 2025, these adjustments can only be made\nonce annually and go into effect January 1st of any given calendar year.\nNotification of policy changes must be provided to all in-network providers at\nleast four months prior to the January 1st effective date. The notification\nmust be provided independent to other policy changes or provider notification\npublications and be easily accessible in electronic provider and enrollee\nportals._\n\n_(3)(a) A determination of medical necessity shall be made only by a licensed\nphysician or a licensed health professional working within their scope of\npractice. The licensed physician or licensed health professional shall\nevaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care services\nrequested by the requesting provider by reviewing and considering the\nrequesting provider 's recommendation, the enrollee's medical or other\nclinical history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances. An\nartificial intelligence, algorithm, or related software tool shall not be the\nsole means used to deny, delay, or modify health care services._\n\n_(b) A carrier and any contracted health care benefit manager that uses an\nartificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool for the purpose of\nprior authorization or prior authorization functions, based in whole or in\npart on medical necessity, or that contracts with or otherwise works through\nan entity that uses an artificial intelligence, algorithm, or related software\ntool for the purpose of prior authorization or prior authorization functions,\nbased in whole or in part on medical necessity, shall ensure all of the\nfollowing:_\n\n_(i) The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool bases its\ndetermination on the following information, as applicable:_\n\n_(A) An enrollee 's medical or other clinical history;_\n\n_(B) Individual clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting\nprovider; and_\n\n_(C) Other relevant clinical information contained in the enrollee 's medical\nor other clinical record;_\n\n_(ii) The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool does not\nbase its determination solely on a group data set;_\n\n_(iii) The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool 's\ncriteria and guidelines complies with this chapter and applicable state and\nfederal law;_\n\n_(iv) The use of the artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software\ntool does not discriminate, directly or indirectly, against an enrollee in\nviolation of state or federal law;_\n\n_(v) The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool is fairly\nand equitably applied, including in accordance with any applicable regulations\nand guidance issued by the federal department of health and human services;_\n\n_(vi) The policies and procedures for using the artificial intelligence,\nalgorithm, or other software tool is open to audit by the office of the\ninsurance commissioner;_\n\n_(vii) The artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other software tool 's\nperformance, use, and outcomes are periodically reviewed to maximize accuracy\nand reliability; and_\n\n_(viii) Patient data is not used beyond its intended and stated purpose,\nconsistent with chapter _70.02_ RCW and the federal health insurance\nportability and accountability act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d et al., as\napplicable._\n\n_(4)_(a) Each carrier shall build and maintain a prior authorization\napplication programming interface that automates the process for in-network\nproviders to determine whether a prior authorization is required for health\ncare services, identify prior authorization information and documentation\nrequirements, and facilitate the exchange of prior authorization requests and\ndeterminations from its electronic health records or practice management\nsystem. The application programming interface must support the exchange of\nprior authorization requests and determinations for health care services\nbeginning January 1, 2025, and must:\n\n(i) Use health level 7 fast health care interoperability resources in\naccordance with standards and provisions defined in 45 C.F.R.

(1) The legislature finds that health insurance carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers for the type and level of care covered for an enrollee&#39;s health care benefits and are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee&#39;s diagnosis or treatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how decisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly utilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or aid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended treatment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior authorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure licensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for making determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and services that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence tools are used to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to ensure these tools are not used to make inappropriate determinations that could impact the health of an enrollee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. RCW <u>48.43.830</u> and 2023 c 382 s 1 are each amended to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior authorization for health care services and prescription drugs:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior authorization process, as designated by each carrier:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization determinations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that submits the prior authorization request through a process other than an electronic prior authorization process:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient information has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any additional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day of submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or facility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination under (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific reasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time frame must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier&#39;s request for additional information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The carrier&#39;s prior authorization requirements must be described in detail and written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most current prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the written clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an electronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be based on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria must be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging information related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect to black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved populations.

(1) The legislature finds that health insurance\ncarriers, health plans, and managed care organizations are the decision makers\nfor the type and level of care covered for an enrollee's health care benefits\nand are not responsible for determining or altering an enrollee's diagnosis or\ntreatment plan. It is not always transparent who the decision maker is or how\ndecisions are made in determining enrollee coverage for treatment,\nprescription drugs, or services. Artificial intelligence is being increasingly\nutilized by carriers, health plans, and managed care organizations to make or\naid in decisions about medical necessity and coverage of provider-recommended\ntreatment.\n\n(2) It is the intent of the legislature to increase transparency in the prior\nauthorization process for health care coverage decisions and to ensure\nlicensed physicians and licensed health professionals remain responsible for\nmaking determinations about coverage for treatment, prescription drugs, and\nservices that are medically necessary. If artificial intelligence tools are\nused to aid in the decision-making process, standards must be put in place to\nensure these tools are not used to make inappropriate determinations that\ncould impact the health of an enrollee.\n\nSec. 2. RCW _48.43.830_ and 2023 c 382 s 1 are each amended to read as\nfollows:\n\n(1) Each carrier offering a health plan issued or renewed on or after January\n1, 2024, shall comply with the following standards related to prior\nauthorization for health care services and prescription drugs:\n\n(a) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization\ndeterminations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that\nsubmits the prior authorization request through an electronic prior\nauthorization process, as designated by each carrier:\n\n(i) For electronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within three calendar days, excluding holidays, of submission of an\nelectronic prior authorization request by the provider or facility that\ncontains the necessary information to make a determination. If insufficient\ninformation has been provided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier\nshall request any additional information from the provider or facility within\none calendar day of submission of the electronic prior authorization request.\n\n(ii) For electronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within one calendar day of submission of an electronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day\nof submission of the electronic prior authorization request.\n\n(b) The carrier shall meet the following time frames for prior authorization\ndeterminations and notifications to a participating provider or facility that\nsubmits the prior authorization request through a process other than an\nelectronic prior authorization process:\n\n(i) For nonelectronic standard prior authorization requests, the carrier shall\nmake a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of the\ndecision within five calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within five calendar days\nof submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.\n\n(ii) For nonelectronic expedited prior authorization requests, the carrier\nshall make a decision and notify the provider or facility of the results of\nthe decision within two calendar days of submission of a nonelectronic prior\nauthorization request by the provider or facility that contains the necessary\ninformation to make a determination. If insufficient information has been\nprovided to the carrier to make a decision, the carrier shall request any\nadditional information from the provider or facility within one calendar day\nof submission of the nonelectronic prior authorization request.\n\n(c) In any instance in which a carrier has determined that a provider or\nfacility has not provided sufficient information for making a determination\nunder (a) and (b) of this subsection, a carrier may establish a specific\nreasonable time frame for submission of the additional information. This time\nframe must be communicated to the provider and enrollee with a carrier's\nrequest for additional information.\n\n(d) The carrier's prior authorization requirements must be described in detail\nand written in easily understandable language. The carrier shall make its most\ncurrent prior authorization requirements and restrictions, including the\nwritten clinical review criteria, available to providers and facilities in an\nelectronic format upon request. The prior authorization requirements must be\nbased on peer-reviewed clinical review criteria. The clinical review criteria\nmust be evidence-based criteria and must accommodate new and emerging\ninformation related to the appropriateness of clinical criteria with respect\nto black and indigenous people, other people of color, gender, and underserved\npopulations. The clinical review criteria must be evaluated and updated, if\nnecessary, at least annually.\n\n~~(2)~~ _(e) When denying a prior authorization determination, the carrier\nshall include the credentials, board certifications, and areas of specialty\nexpertise and training of the provider who had clinical oversight over the\ndetermination in any notification sent to the health plan enrollee and\nprovider requesting or referring the service._\n\n_(2)(a) Carriers maintain the ability to make adjustments to policies and\nprocedures that impact the applicability of their prior authorization\nrequirements. Except as provided in (b) of this subsection, beginning August\n1, 2025, these adjustments can only be made quarterly and go into effect\neither January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, or October 1st of any given calendar\nyear. Notification of policy changes must be provided to all in-network\nproviders at least 45 days prior to the quarterly update and must be available\nto providers in a single location on the carrier 's website. The notification\nmust be provided independent of other policy changes or provider notification\npublications and be easily accessible in electronic provider and enrollee\nportals._\n\n_(b) Adjustments to policies and procedures that impact the applicability of\nprior authorization requirements to reflect federal food and drug\nadministration approvals, national comprehensive cancer network guidelines,\nUnited States preventive services task force guidelines, or state or national\npublic health emergencies may be made at any time and shall be posted on the\nwebsite referenced in (a) of this subsection. Notification of adjustments made\nunder this subsection must be provided to all in-network providers as soon as\npossible._\n\n_(3)(a) Only a licensed physician or a licensed health professional working\nwithin their scope of practice may deny a prior authorization request based on\nmedical necessity. The licensed physician or licensed health professional\nshall evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the health care\nservices requested by the requesting provider by reviewing and considering the\nrequesting provider 's recommendation, the enrollee's medical or other\nclinical history, as applicable, and individual clinical circumstances. An\nartificial intelligence tool shall not be the sole means used to deny, delay,\nor modify health care services. Algorithms may be used to process and approve\nprior authorization requests, but may not be used without human review to deny\ncare based on a determination of medical necessity._\n\n_(b) A carrier that uses an artificial intelligence tool for the purpose of\nprior authorization or prior authorization functions, based in whole or in\npart on medical necessity, or that contracts with or otherwise works through\nan entity that uses an artificial intelligence tool for the purpose of prior\nauthorization or prior authorization functions, based in whole or in part on\nmedical necessity, shall ensure all of the following:_\n\n_(i) The artificial intelligence tool bases its determination on the following\ninformation, as applicable:_\n\n_(A) An enrollee 's medical or other clinical history, including demographic\ndata; and_\n\n_(B) Individual clinical circumstances as presented by the requesting\nprovider;_\n\n_(ii) The artificial intelligence tool does not base its determination solely\non a group data set;_\n\n_(iii) The artificial intelligence tool 's criteria and guidelines comply with\nthis chapter and applicable state and federal law;_\n\n_(iv) The use of the artificial intelligence tool does not discriminate,\ndirectly or indirectly, against an enrollee in violation of state or federal\nlaw;_\n\n_(v) The artificial intelligence tool is fairly and equitably applied,\nincluding in accordance with any applicable regulations and guidance issued by\nthe federal department of health and human services;_\n\n_(vi) The policies and procedures for using the artificial intelligence tool\nare open to audit by the office of the insurance commissioner under chapter\n_48.37_ RCW;_\n\n_(vii) The artificial intelligence tool 's performance, use, and outcomes are\nperiodically reviewed by the carrier to maximize accuracy and reliability;\nand_\n\n_(viii) Patient data is not used beyond its intended and stated purpose,\nconsistent with chapter _70.02_ RCW and the federal health insurance\nportability and accountability act of 1996, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1320d et al., as\napplicable._\n\n_(4)_(a) Each carrier shall build and maintain a prior authorization\napplication programming interface that automates the process for in-network\nproviders to determine whether a prior authorization is required for health\ncare services, identify prior authorization information and documentation\nrequirements, and facilitate the exchange of prior authorization requests and\ndeterminations from its electronic health records or practice management\nsystem. The application programming interface must support the exchange of\nprior authorization requests and determinations for health care services\nbeginning January 1, 2025, and must:\n\n(i) Use health level 7 fast health care interoperability resources in\naccordance with standards and provisions defined in 45 C.F.R.
