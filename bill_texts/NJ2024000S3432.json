A business would be considered primarily\nengaged in such an industry if at least 50 percent of the business's employees\nare engaged in AI-related activities, or at least 50 percent of the business's\nrevenue is generated from AI-related activities. The bill defines \"artificial\nintelligence\" or \"AI\" to mean the development of software and hardware, and\nthe end-use application of technologies that are able to perform tasks\nnormally requiring human intelligence, including, but not limited to, visual\nperception, speech recognition, decision-making, translation between\nlanguages, and generative artificial intelligence, which generates new content\nin response to user inputs of data.\n\nThe bill provides that an eligible business that executes a project agreement\nwith the EDA pursuant to the provisions of the Next New Jersey Program may\nreceive tax credits as authorized under the project agreement. The bill\ndefines \"project\" to mean a capital investment at a qualified business\nfacility and an employment commitment specified in the eligible business's\nproject agreement. The bill defines \"qualified business facility\" to mean any\nbuilding, complex of buildings, or structural components of buildings, and all\nmachinery and equipment located therein, used in connection with the operation\nof an eligible business.\n\nUnder the bill, the amount of the tax credit allowed for a particular project\nwould equal to the lesser of: (1) the product of 0.1 percent of the eligible\nbusiness's total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time\njobs; (2) 25 percent of the eligible business's total capital investment; or\n(3) $250 million.\n\nThe bill provides that up to $500 million in tax credits, originally allocated\nfor the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, be made available to\neligible AI businesses under the Next New Jersey Program. Additionally, the\nbill provides that if the EDA awards less than the annual limitation of tax\ncredits under the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, then the\nuncommitted credits would also be made available to eligible AI businesses\nunder the Next New Jersey Program.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

A business would be considered primarily\nengaged in such an industry if at least 50 percent of the business's employees\nare engaged in AI-related activities, or at least 50 percent of the business's\nrevenue is generated from AI-related activities. The bill defines \"artificial\nintelligence\" or \"AI\" to mean the development of software and hardware, and\nthe end-use application of technologies that are able to perform tasks\nnormally requiring human intelligence, including, but not limited to, visual\nperception, speech recognition, decision-making, translation between\nlanguages, and generative artificial intelligence, which generates new content\nin response to user inputs of data.\n\nThe bill provides that an eligible business that executes a project agreement\nwith the EDA pursuant to the provisions of the Next New Jersey Program may\nreceive tax credits as authorized under the project agreement. The bill\ndefines \"project\" to mean a capital investment at a qualified business\nfacility and an employment commitment specified in the eligible business's\nproject agreement. The bill defines \"qualified business facility\" to mean any\nbuilding, complex of buildings, or structural components of buildings, and all\nmachinery and equipment located therein, used in connection with the operation\nof an eligible business.\n\nUnder the bill, the amount of the tax credit allowed for a particular project\nwould equal to the lesser of: (1) the product of 0.1 percent of the eligible\nbusiness's total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time\njobs; (2) 25 percent of the eligible business's total capital investment; or\n(3) $250 million.\n\nThe bill provides that up to $500 million in tax credits, originally allocated\nfor the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, be made available to\neligible AI businesses under the Next New Jersey Program. Additionally, the\nbill provides that if the EDA awards less than the annual limitation of tax\ncredits under the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, then the\nuncommitted credits would also be made available to eligible AI businesses\nunder the Next New Jersey Program.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

(C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), whichever is greater, then the eligible business shall forfeit its tax credit amount for that tax period and each subsequent tax period, until the first tax period for which documentation demonstrating the restoration of the number of new employees in eligible positions, or the salaries thereof, to 80 percent of the number specified in the project agreement or required as a condition of program eligibility pursuant to section 4 of P.L. , c.

(C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and any other terms and conditions that the director may prescribe.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">c.

Eligible AI businesses would include a business or division that is primarily engaged in the artificial intelligence industry or large-scale artificial intelligence data center industry. A business would be considered primarily engaged in such an industry if at least 50 percent of the business&#39;s employees are engaged in AI-related activities, or at least 50 percent of the business&#39;s revenue is generated from AI-related activities. The bill defines &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; to mean the development of software and hardware, and the end-use application of technologies that are able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, including, but not limited to, visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, translation between languages, and generative artificial intelligence, which generates new content in response to user inputs of data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The bill provides that an eligible business that executes a project agreement with the EDA pursuant to the provisions of the Next New Jersey Program may receive tax credits as authorized under the project agreement.

A business would be considered primarily\nengaged in such an industry if at least 50 percent of the business's employees\nare engaged in AI-related activities, or at least 50 percent of the business's\nrevenue is generated from AI-related activities. The bill defines \"artificial\nintelligence\" or \"AI\" to mean the development of software and hardware, and\nthe end-use application of technologies that are able to perform tasks\nnormally requiring human intelligence, including, but not limited to, visual\nperception, speech recognition, decision-making, translation between\nlanguages, and generative artificial intelligence, which generates new content\nin response to user inputs of data.\n\nThe bill provides that an eligible business that executes a project agreement\nwith the EDA pursuant to the provisions of the Next New Jersey Program may\nreceive tax credits as authorized under the project agreement. The bill\ndefines \"project\" to mean a capital investment at a qualified business\nfacility and an employment commitment specified in the eligible business's\nproject agreement. The bill defines \"qualified business facility\" to mean any\nbuilding, complex of buildings, or structural components of buildings, and all\nmachinery and equipment located therein, used in connection with the operation\nof an eligible business.\n\nUnder the bill, the amount of the tax credit allowed for a particular project\nwould equal to the lesser of: (1) the product of 0.1 percent of the eligible\nbusiness's total capital investment multiplied by the number of new full-time\njobs; (2) 25 percent of the eligible business's total capital investment; or\n(3) $250 million.\n\nThe bill provides that up to $500 million in tax credits, originally allocated\nfor the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, be made available to\neligible AI businesses under the Next New Jersey Program. Additionally, the\nbill provides that if the EDA awards less than the annual limitation of tax\ncredits under the New Jersey Aspire Program and the Emerge Program, then the\nuncommitted credits would also be made available to eligible AI businesses\nunder the Next New Jersey Program.\n\nEstablishes Next New Jersey Program for artificial intelligence investments.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
