Title 23 (commencing with Section 3273.72) is added to Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, to read:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">23. Social Media Platforms Endangering Californians</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3273.72. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) In California, corporations, like natural people, do not have a right to participate, through aiding, abetting, or conspiring, in hate crimes directed at vulnerable California populations, which is made unlawful by Section 422.6 of the Penal Code, to intimidate or terrorize Californians because of their sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation, citizenship, primary language, or immigration status, which is made unlawful by Sections 51.7 and 51.9 of the Civil Code, or to interfere with the ability of those Californians to exercise their constitutional rights, which is made unlawful by Sections 52 and 52.1 of the Civil Code.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) (1) Social media platforms&#39; failure to moderate content is a matter of life and death for minorities historically subject to discrimination.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) According to a December 2024 report by the County of Los Angeles Commission on Human Relations, &quot;[h]ate crimes in which anti-immigrant slurs were used climbed 31% [...] the largest number ever recorded since we began tracking this phenomenon in 2007.&quot;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(3) According to American University, when it comes to being bullied on social media, &quot;[a]mong the most victimized are people in the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) community, especially teens and young adults.&quot; Anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and inflammatory accusations of &quot;grooming&quot; have recently surged by over 400 percent across social media platforms, according to a recent report released by the Human Rights Campaign and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(4) Antisemitic incidents are spiking dramatically and are at all-time highs, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). More than 10,000 antisemitic incidents occurred between October 7, 2023, and September 2024, which is up from 3,325 incidents during the prior year. That marks the most incidents recorded in a 12-month period by the organization since it began tracking threats in 1979.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) (1) Likewise, social media platforms have a documented record of accepting money from advertisements that plainly and violently threaten women and that clearly violate their own terms of service. In one 2023 study, a nonprofit placed advertisements that &quot;referred to women as prostitutes, psychopaths, or vermin, and called for them to be beaten and killed.&quot; Researchers recently said they detected a four-fold increase in the level of misogynistic content suggested by TikTok over a five-day period of monitoring as the algorithm served more extreme videos often focused on anger and blame directed at women.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) Relatedly, as illustrated in such cases as Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 604, California has adopted Prosser and Keaton on The Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) Section 46, p. 292, which states that &quot;those who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt his acts done for their benefit, are equally liable with him.&quot; This principle of liability is reflected in Section 876 of the Restatement Second of Torts.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) Moreover, as illustrated by such cases as Summers v. Tice (1948) 33 Cal.2d 80, it has long been the law in California that &quot;if a party cannot identify which of two or more defendants caused an injury, the burden of proof may shift to the defendants to show that they were not responsible for the harm.&quot; (Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 598).</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(e) For all of these reasons, the Legislature declares it necessary in order to preserve the peace, welfare, and lives of its residents to clarify the applicability of current laws against hate crime, terrorism, and intimidation to social media platforms.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3273.73. As used in this title, &quot;social media platform&quot; means a social media platform, as defined in Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code, that generates more than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) per year in gross revenues.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3273.74. (a) A social media platform that violates Section 31 or 422.6 of the Penal Code or Section 51.7, 51.9, 52, or 52.1 of the Civil Code, including through its algorithms that relay content to users, or aids, abets, acts in concert, or conspires in a violation of any of those sections, or is a joint tortfeasor in an action alleging a violation of any of those sections, shall, in addition to any other remedy, in an action brought pursuant to this section be liable for a civil penalty for each violation sufficient to deter future violations, but not to exceed the following:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(1) For an intentional violation, an amount equal to three months of the gross revenue of the social media platform preceding the judgment.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) For a knowing or willful violation, an amount equal to two months of the gross revenue of the platform preceding the judgment.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(3) For a reckless violation, an amount equal to one month of the gross revenue of the platform preceding the judgment.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(4) If the evidence demonstrates that the platform knew, or should have known, that the plaintiff was a minor, the court may award up to twice the penalties described in this subdivision.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) (1) For purposes of this section, deploying an artificial intelligence or algorithm that relays content to users may be considered to be an act of the platform independent from the message of the content relayed.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) A platform shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of the operations of its own artificial intelligence and algorithms, including how and under what circumstances its artificial intelligence and algorithms deliver content to some users but not to others.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">SEC. 2. (a) The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of this act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Any waiver of this act shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to public policy.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">SECTION 1. Section 48901.8 of the Education Code is amended to read:</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">48901.8. (a) (1) The governing board of a school district, a county board of education, or the governing body of a charter school shall adopt a policy to limit or prohibit the use by its pupils of social media while the pupils are at a schoolsite or while the pupils are under the supervision and control of an employee or employees of that school district, county office of education, or charter school.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(2) This section does not authorize monitoring, collecting, or otherwise accessing any information related to a pupil&#39;s online activities.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(b) For purposes of this section, &quot;social media&quot; means a &quot;social media platform&quot; as that term is defined in Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">SEC. 2.

The bill would also make findings and declarations related to its\nprovisions._\n\n~~Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school district, a county\nboard of education, or the governing body of a charter school to adopt a\npolicy to limit or prohibit the use by its pupils of social media, as defined,\nwhile the pupils are at a schoolsite or while the pupils are under the\nsupervision and control of an employee or employees of that school district,\ncounty office of education, or charter school, as provided.~~\n\n~~This bill would require, instead of authorize, the adoption of a policy to\nlimit or prohibit the use by its pupils of social media, as provided.

Title 23 (commencing with Section 3273.72) is added to Part 4 of\nDivision 3 of the Civil Code, to read:_\n\n_23\\. Social Media Platforms Endangering Californians_\n\n_3273.72. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:_\n\n_(a) In California, corporations, like natural people, do not have a right to\nparticipate, through aiding, abetting, or conspiring, in hate crimes directed\nat vulnerable California populations, which is made unlawful by Section 422.6\nof the Penal Code, to intimidate or terrorize Californians because of their\nsex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, disability, medical\ncondition, genetic information, marital status, sexual orientation,\ncitizenship, primary language, or immigration status, which is made unlawful\nby Sections 51.7 and 51.9 of the Civil Code, or to interfere with the ability\nof those Californians to exercise their constitutional rights, which is made\nunlawful by Sections 52 and 52.1 of the Civil Code._\n\n_(b) (1) Social media platforms ' failure to moderate content is a matter of\nlife and death for minorities historically subject to discrimination._\n\n_(2) According to a December 2024 report by the County of Los Angeles\nCommission on Human Relations, \"[h]ate crimes in which anti-immigrant slurs\nwere used climbed 31% [...] the largest number ever recorded since we began\ntracking this phenomenon in 2007.\"_\n\n_(3) According to American University, when it comes to being bullied on\nsocial media, \"[a]mong the most victimized are people in the LGBTQ (lesbian,\ngay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning) community, especially teens and\nyoung adults.\" Anti-LGBTQ+ misinformation and inflammatory accusations of\n\"grooming\" have recently surged by over 400 percent across social media\nplatforms, according to a recent report released by the Human Rights Campaign\nand the Center for Countering Digital Hate._\n\n_(4) Antisemitic incidents are spiking dramatically and are at all-time highs,\naccording to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). More than 10,000 antisemitic\nincidents occurred between October 7, 2023, and September 2024, which is up\nfrom 3,325 incidents during the prior year. That marks the most incidents\nrecorded in a 12-month period by the organization since it began tracking\nthreats in 1979._\n\n_(c) (1) Likewise, social media platforms have a documented record of\naccepting money from advertisements that plainly and violently threaten women\nand that clearly violate their own terms of service. In one 2023 study, a\nnonprofit placed advertisements that \"referred to women as prostitutes,\npsychopaths, or vermin, and called for them to be beaten and killed.\"\nResearchers recently said they detected a four-fold increase in the level of\nmisogynistic content suggested by TikTok over a five-day period of monitoring\nas the algorithm served more extreme videos often focused on anger and blame\ndirected at women._\n\n_(2) Relatedly, as illustrated in such cases as Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories\n(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 604, California has adopted Prosser and Keaton on The\nLaw of Torts (4th ed. 1971) Section 46, p. 292, which states that \"those who,\nin pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious act, actively\ntake part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who lend aid or\nencouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt his acts done for their\nbenefit, are equally liable with him.\" This principle of liability is\nreflected in Section 876 of the Restatement Second of Torts._\n\n_(d) Moreover, as illustrated by such cases as Summers v. Tice (1948) 33\nCal.2d 80, it has long been the law in California that \"if a party cannot\nidentify which of two or more defendants caused an injury, the burden of proof\nmay shift to the defendants to show that they were not responsible for the\nharm.\" (Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 598)._\n\n_(e) For all of these reasons, the Legislature declares it necessary in order\nto preserve the peace, welfare, and lives of its residents to clarify the\napplicability of current laws against hate crime, terrorism, and intimidation\nto social media platforms._\n\n_3273.73. As used in this title, \"social media platform\" means a social media\nplatform, as defined in Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code,\nthat generates more than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) per year\nin gross revenues._\n\n_3273.74. (a) A social media platform that violates Section 31 or 422.6 of the\nPenal Code or Section 51.7, 51.9, 52, or 52.1 of the Civil Code, including\nthrough its algorithms that relay content to users, or aids, abets, acts in\nconcert, or conspires in a violation of any of those sections, or is a joint\ntortfeasor in an action alleging a violation of any of those sections, shall,\nin addition to any other remedy, in an action brought pursuant to this section\nbe liable for a civil penalty for each violation sufficient to deter future\nviolations, but not to exceed the following:_\n\n_(1) For an intentional violation, an amount equal to three months of the\ngross revenue of the social media platform preceding the judgment._\n\n_(2) For a knowing or willful violation, an amount equal to two months of the\ngross revenue of the platform preceding the judgment._\n\n_(3) For a reckless violation, an amount equal to one month of the gross\nrevenue of the platform preceding the judgment._\n\n_(4) If the evidence demonstrates that the platform knew, or should have\nknown, that the plaintiff was a minor, the court may award up to twice the\npenalties described in this subdivision._\n\n_(b) (1) For purposes of this section, deploying an artificial intelligence or\nalgorithm that relays content to users may be considered to be an act of the\nplatform independent from the message of the content relayed._\n\n_(2) A platform shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of the operations of\nits own artificial intelligence and algorithms, including how and under what\ncircumstances its artificial intelligence and algorithms deliver content to\nsome users but not to others._\n\n_SEC. 2. (a) The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of\nthis act or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect\nother provisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid\nprovision or application._\n\n_(b) Any waiver of this act shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to\npublic policy._\n\n~~SECTION 1. Section 48901.8 of the Education Code is amended to read:~~\n\n~~48901.8. (a) (1) The governing board of a school district, a county board of\neducation, or the governing body of a charter school shall adopt a policy to\nlimit or prohibit the use by its pupils of social media while the pupils are\nat a schoolsite or while the pupils are under the supervision and control of\nan employee or employees of that school district, county office of education,\nor charter school.~~\n\n~~(2) This section does not authorize monitoring, collecting, or otherwise\naccessing any information related to a pupil 's online activities.~~\n\n~~(b) For purposes of this section, \"social media\" means a \"social media\nplatform\" as that term is defined in Section 22675 of the Business and\nProfessions Code.~~\n\n~~SEC. 2.

In one 2023 study, a nonprofit\nplaced advertisements that \"referred to women as prostitutes, psychopaths, or\nvermin, and called for them to be beaten and killed.\" Researchers recently\nsaid they detected a four-fold increase in the level of misogynistic content\nsuggested by TikTok over a five-day period of monitoring as the algorithm\nserved more extreme videos often focused on anger and blame directed at women.\n\n(2) Relatedly, as illustrated in such cases as Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories\n(1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 604, California has adopted Prosser and~~Keaton~~\n_Keeton_ on The Law of Torts (4th ed. 1971) Section 46, p. 292, which states\nthat \"those who, in pursuance of a common plan or design to commit a tortious\nact, actively take part in it, or further it by cooperation or request, or who\nlend aid or encouragement to the wrongdoer, or ratify and adopt his acts done\nfor their benefit, are equally liable with him.\" This principle of liability\nis reflected in Section 876 of the Restatement Second of Torts.\n\n(d) Moreover, as illustrated by such cases as Summers v. Tice (1948) 33 Cal.2d\n80, it has long been the law in California that \"if a party cannot identify\nwhich of two or more defendants caused an injury, the burden of proof may\nshift to the defendants to show that they were not responsible for the harm.\"\n(Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (1980) 26 Cal.3d 588, 598).\n\n(e) For all of these reasons, the Legislature declares it necessary in order\nto preserve the peace, welfare, and lives of its residents to clarify the\napplicability of current laws against hate crime, terrorism, and intimidation\nto social media platforms.\n\n3273.73. As used in this title, \"social media platform\" means a social media\nplatform, as defined in Section 22675 of the Business and Professions Code,\nthat generates more than one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) per year\nin gross revenues.\n\n3273.74. (a) A social media platform that violates Section 31 or 422.6 of the\nPenal Code or Section 51.7, 51.9, 52, or 52.1 of the Civil Code, including\nthrough its algorithms that relay content to users, or aids, abets, acts in\nconcert, or conspires in a violation of any of those sections, or is a joint\ntortfeasor in an action alleging a violation of any of those sections, shall,\nin addition to any other remedy, in an action brought pursuant to this section\nbe liable for a civil penalty for each violation sufficient to deter future\nviolations, but not to exceed the following:\n\n~~(1) For an intentional violation, an amount equal to three months of the\ngross revenue of the social media platform preceding the judgment.~~\n\n~~(2)~~\n\n_(1)_ For~~a knowing~~ _an intentional, knowing,_ or willful violation,~~an\namount equal to two months of the gross revenue of the platform preceding the\njudgment.~~ _a civil penalty of up to one million dollars ($1,000,000)._\n\n~~(3)~~\n\n_(2)_ For a reckless violation,~~an amount equal to one month of the gross\nrevenue of the platform preceding the judgment.~~ _a civil penalty of up to\nfive hundred thousand dollars ($500,000)._\n\n~~(4)~~\n\n_(3)_ If the evidence demonstrates that the platform knew, or should have\nknown, that the plaintiff was a minor, the court may award up to twice the\npenalties described in this subdivision.\n\n(b) (1) For purposes of this section, deploying an artificial intelligence or\nalgorithm that relays content to users may be considered to be an act of the\nplatform independent from the message of the content relayed.\n\n(2) A platform shall be deemed to have actual knowledge of the operations of\nits own artificial intelligence and algorithms, including how and under what\ncircumstances its artificial intelligence and algorithms deliver content to\nsome users but not to others.\n\nSEC. 2. (a) The provisions of this act are severable. If any provision of this\nact or its application is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other\nprovisions or applications that can be given effect without the invalid\nprovision or application.\n\n(b) Any waiver of this act shall be void and unenforceable as contrary to\npublic policy.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
