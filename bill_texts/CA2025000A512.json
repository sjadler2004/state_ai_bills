Health care coverage: prior authorization. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would shorten the timeline for prior authorization requests to no more than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Health care coverage: prior authorization.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides\nfor the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the\nDepartment of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a\ncrime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the\nDepartment of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care\nservice plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a\nlicensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to\nevaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests\nfor health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or\nconcurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires\nutilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan's\nor insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by\nthe plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the\nenrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or\nthe normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as\nspecified.\n\nThis bill would shorten the timeline for prior authorization requests to no\nmore than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from\nthe plan's or insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and\nrequested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful\nviolation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime,\nthe bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. Section 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n\n1367.01. (a) A health care service plan and any entity with which it contracts\nfor services that include utilization review or utilization management\nfunctions, that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and\napproves, modifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical\nnecessity, requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with\nthe provision of health care services to enrollees, or that delegates these\nfunctions to medical groups or independent practice associations or to other\ncontracting providers, shall comply with this section.\n\n(b) A health care service plan that is subject to this section shall have\nwritten policies and procedures establishing the process by which the plan\nprospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and approves,\nmodifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical necessity,\nrequests by providers of health care services for plan enrollees. These\npolicies and procedures shall ensure that decisions based on the medical\nnecessity of proposed health care services are consistent with criteria or\nguidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes. These\ncriteria and guidelines shall be developed pursuant to Section 1363.5. These\npolicies and procedures, and a description of the process by which the plan\nreviews and approves, modifies, delays, or denies requests by providers prior\nto, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services\nto enrollees, shall be filed with the director for review and approval, and\nshall be disclosed by the plan to providers and enrollees upon request, and by\nthe plan to the public upon request.\n\n(c) A health care service plan subject to this section, except a plan that\nmeets the requirements of Section 1351.2, shall employ or designate a medical\ndirector who holds an unrestricted license to practice medicine in this state\nissued pursuant to Section 2050 of the Business and Professions Code or\npursuant to the Osteopathic Act, or, if the plan is a specialized health care\nservice plan, a clinical director with California licensure in a clinical area\nappropriate to the type of care provided by the specialized health care\nservice plan. The medical director or clinical director shall ensure that the\nprocess by which the plan reviews and approves, modifies, or denies, based in\nwhole or in part on medical necessity, requests by providers prior to,\nretrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to\nenrollees, complies with the requirements of this section.\n\n(d) If health plan personnel, or individuals under contract to the plan to\nreview requests by providers, approve the provider's request, pursuant to\nsubdivision (b), the decision shall be communicated to the provider pursuant\nto subdivision (h).\n\n(e) ~~No~~ _An_ individual, other than a licensed physician or a licensed\nhealth care professional who is competent to evaluate the specific clinical\nissues involved in the health care services requested by the provider,~~may~~\n_shall not_ deny or modify requests for authorization of health care services\nfor an enrollee for reasons of medical necessity.

These\ncriteria and guidelines shall be developed pursuant to the requirements of\nSection 1363.5.\n\n(g) If the health care service plan requests medical information from\nproviders in order to determine whether to approve, modify, or deny requests\nfor authorization, the plan shall request only the information reasonably\nnecessary to make the determination.\n\n(h) In determining whether to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers\nprior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care\nservices to enrollees, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, a\nhealth care service plan subject to this section shall meet the following\nrequirements:\n\n_(1) Decisions based on medical necessity to approve, modify, or deny requests\nby providers prior to the provision of health care services to enrollees shall\nbe made in a timely fashion appropriate for the nature of the enrollee 's\ncondition, not to exceed 48 hours for standard requests, or 24 hours for\nurgent requests, from the plan's receipt of the information reasonably\nnecessary and requested by the plan to make the determination. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, \"urgent\" means the enrollee's condition is such that the\nenrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to their health, including the\npotential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function, or that the\nnormal timeframe for the decisionmaking process for standard requests would be\ndetrimental to the enrollee's life or health or could jeopardize the\nenrollee's ability to regain maximum function._\n\n~~(1)~~\n\n_(2)_ Decisions _based on medical necessity_ to approve, modify, or~~deny,\nbased on medical necessity,~~ _deny_ requests by providers~~prior to, or~~\nconcurrent with the provision of health care services to enrollees that do not\nmeet the requirements for the time period for review required by\nparagraph~~(2),~~ _(3)_ shall be made in a timely fashion appropriate for the\nnature of the enrollee's condition, not to exceed five business days from the\nplan's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the\nplan to make the determination.

Health care coverage: prior authorization. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would shorten the timeline for prior authorization requests to no more than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Health care coverage: prior authorization.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides\nfor the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the\nDepartment of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a\ncrime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the\nDepartment of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care\nservice plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a\nlicensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to\nevaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests\nfor health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or\nconcurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires\nutilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan's\nor insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by\nthe plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the\nenrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or\nthe normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as\nspecified.\n\nThis bill would shorten the timeline for prior authorization requests to no\nmore than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from\nthe plan's or insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and\nrequested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful\nviolation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime,\nthe bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. Section 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n\n1367.01. (a) A health care service plan and any entity with which it contracts\nfor services that include utilization review or utilization management\nfunctions, that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and\napproves, modifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical\nnecessity, requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with\nthe provision of health care services to enrollees, or that delegates these\nfunctions to medical groups or independent practice associations or to other\ncontracting providers, shall comply with this section.\n\n(b) A health care service plan that is subject to this section shall have\nwritten policies and procedures establishing the process by which the plan\nprospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and approves,\nmodifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical necessity,\nrequests by providers of health care services for plan enrollees. These\npolicies and procedures shall ensure that decisions based on the medical\nnecessity of proposed health care services are consistent with criteria or\nguidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes. These\ncriteria and guidelines shall be developed pursuant to Section 1363.5. These\npolicies and procedures, and a description of the process by which the plan\nreviews and approves, modifies, delays, or denies requests by providers prior\nto, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services\nto enrollees, shall be filed with the director for review and approval, and\nshall be disclosed by the plan to providers and enrollees upon request, and by\nthe plan to the public upon request.\n\n(c) A health care service plan subject to this section, except a plan that\nmeets the requirements of Section 1351.2, shall employ or designate a medical\ndirector who holds an unrestricted license to practice medicine in this state\nissued pursuant to Section 2050 of the Business and Professions Code or\npursuant to the Osteopathic Act, or, if the plan is a specialized health care\nservice plan, a clinical director with California licensure in a clinical area\nappropriate to the type of care provided by the specialized health care\nservice plan. The medical director or clinical director shall ensure that the\nprocess by which the plan reviews and approves, modifies, or denies, based in\nwhole or in part on medical necessity, requests by providers prior to,\nretrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to\nenrollees, complies with the requirements of this section.\n\n(d) If health plan personnel, or individuals under contract to the plan to\nreview requests by providers, approve the provider's request, pursuant to\nsubdivision (b), the decision shall be communicated to the provider pursuant\nto subdivision (h).\n\n(e) An individual, other than a licensed physician or a licensed health care\nprofessional who is competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues\ninvolved in the health care services requested by the provider, shall not deny\nor modify requests for authorization of health care services for an enrollee\nfor reasons of medical necessity. The decision of the physician or other\nhealth care professional shall be communicated to the provider and the\nenrollee pursuant to subdivision (h).\n\n(f) The criteria or guidelines used by the health care service plan to\ndetermine whether to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers prior to,\nretrospectively, or concurrent with, the provision of health care services to\nenrollees shall be consistent with clinical principles and processes. These\ncriteria and guidelines shall be developed pursuant to the requirements of\nSection 1363.5.\n\n(g) If the health care service plan requests medical information from\nproviders in order to determine whether to approve, modify, or deny requests\nfor authorization, the plan shall request only the information reasonably\nnecessary to make the determination.\n\n(h) In determining whether to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers\nprior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care\nservices to enrollees, based in whole or in part on medical necessity, a\nhealth care service plan subject to this section shall meet the following\nrequirements:\n\n(1) Decisions based on medical necessity to approve, modify, or deny requests\nby providers prior to the provision of health care services to enrollees shall\nbe made in a timely fashion appropriate for the nature of the enrollee's\ncondition, not to exceed 48 hours for standard requests, or 24 hours for\nurgent requests, from the plan's receipt of the information reasonably\nnecessary and requested by the plan to make the determination. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, \"urgent\" means the enrollee's condition is such that the\nenrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to their health,~~including~~\n_including, but not limited to,_ the potential loss of life, limb, or other\nmajor bodily function, or that the normal timeframe for the decisionmaking\nprocess for standard requests would be detrimental to the enrollee's life or\nhealth or could jeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function.\n\n(2) Decisions based on medical necessity to approve, modify, or deny requests\nby providers concurrent with the provision of health care services to\nenrollees that do not meet the requirements for the time period for review\nrequired by paragraph (3) shall be made in a timely fashion appropriate for\nthe nature of the enrollee's condition, not to exceed five business days from\nthe plan's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by\nthe plan to make the determination. In cases where the review is\nretrospective, the decision shall be communicated to the individual who\nreceived services, or to the individual's designee, within 30 days of the\nreceipt of information that is reasonably necessary to make this\ndetermination, and shall be communicated to the provider in a manner that is\nconsistent with current law. For purposes of this section, retrospective\nreviews shall be for care rendered on or after January 1, 2000.\n\n(3) When the enrollee's condition is such that the enrollee faces an imminent\nand serious threat to the enrollee's health,~~including~~ _including, but not\nlimited to,_ the potential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function,\nor the normal timeframe for the decisionmaking process, as described in\nparagraph (2), would be detrimental to the enrollee's life or health or could\njeopardize the enrollee's ability to regain maximum function, decisions to\napprove, modify, or deny requests by providers concurrent with the provision\nof health care services to enrollees, shall be made in a timely fashion\nappropriate for the nature of the enrollee's condition, not to exceed 72 hours\nor, if shorter, the period of time required under Section 2719 of the federal\nPublic Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300gg-19) and any subsequent rules\nor regulations issued thereunder, after the plan's receipt of the information\nreasonably necessary and requested by the plan to make the determination.\nNothing in this section shall be construed to alter the requirements of\nsubdivision (b) of Section 1371.4. Notwithstanding Section 1371.4, the\nrequirements of this division shall be applicable to all health plans and\nother entities conducting utilization review or utilization management.\n\n(4) Decisions to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers for\nauthorization prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of health care\nservices to enrollees shall be communicated to the requesting provider within\n24 hours of the decision. Except for concurrent review decisions pertaining to\ncare that is underway, which shall be communicated to the enrollee's treating\nprovider within 24 hours, decisions resulting in denial, delay, or\nmodification of all or part of the requested health care service shall be\ncommunicated to the enrollee in writing within two business days of the\ndecision. In the case of concurrent review, care shall not be discontinued\nuntil the enrollee's treating provider has been notified of the plan's\ndecision and a care plan has been agreed upon by the treating provider that is\nappropriate for the medical needs of that patient.\n\n(5) Communications regarding decisions to approve requests by providers prior\nto, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services\nto enrollees shall specify the specific health care service approved.\nResponses regarding decisions to deny, delay, or modify health care services\nrequested by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the\nprovision of health care services to enrollees shall be communicated to the\nenrollee in writing, and to providers initially by telephone or facsimile,\nexcept with regard to decisions rendered retrospectively, and then in writing,\nand shall include a clear and concise explanation of the reasons for the\nplan's decision, a description of the criteria or guidelines used, and the\nclinical reasons for the decisions regarding medical necessity.

A proceeding for the issuance of an order\nassessing administrative penalties shall be subject to appropriate notice to,\nand an opportunity for a hearing with regard to, the person affected, in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of Section 1397. The administrative penalties\nshall not be deemed an exclusive remedy for the director. These penalties\nshall be paid to the Managed Care Administrative Fines and Penalties Fund and\nshall be used for the purposes specified in Section 1341.45.\n\n(i) A health care service plan subject to this section shall maintain\ntelephone access for providers to request authorization for health care\nservices.\n\n(j) A health care service plan subject to this section that reviews requests\nby providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with, the provision of\nhealth care services to enrollees shall establish, as part of the quality\nassurance program required by Section 1370, a process by which the plan's\ncompliance with this section is assessed and evaluated.

Health care coverage: prior authorization. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the Department of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care service plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a licensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to evaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or concurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires utilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the enrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or the normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would shorten the timeline for prior<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> or concurrent</u> authorization requests to no more than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent requests from the plan&#39;s or insurer&#39;s receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination. Because a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

These policies and procedures shall ensure that decisions based on the medical necessity of proposed health care services are consistent with criteria or guidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes. These criteria and guidelines shall be developed pursuant to Section 1363.5. These policies and procedures, and a description of the process by which the plan reviews and approves, modifies, delays, or denies requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of health care services to enrollees, shall be filed with the director for review and approval, and shall be disclosed by the plan to providers and enrollees upon request, and by the plan to the public upon request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A health care service plan subject to this section, except a plan that meets the requirements of Section 1351.2, shall employ or designate a medical director who holds an unrestricted license to practice medicine in this state issued pursuant to Section 2050 of the Business and Professions Code or pursuant to the Osteopathic Act, or, if the plan is a specialized health care service plan, a clinical director with California licensure in a clinical area appropriate to the type of care provided by the specialized health care service plan.

For purposes of this section, retrospective reviews shall be for care rendered on or after January 1, 2000.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) When the enrollee&#39;s condition is such that the enrollee faces an imminent and serious threat to the enrollee&#39;s health, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function, or the normal timeframe for the decisionmaking process, as described in paragraph (2), would be detrimental to the enrollee&#39;s life or health or could jeopardize the enrollee&#39;s ability to regain maximum function, decisions to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers concurrent with the provision of health care services to enrollees, shall be made in a timely fashion appropriate for the nature of the enrollee&#39;s condition, not to exceed<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> 72</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> 24</u> hours or, if shorter, the period of time required under Section 2719 of the federal Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter the requirements of subdivision (b) of Section 1371.4. Notwithstanding Section 1371.4, the requirements of this division shall be applicable to all health plans and other entities conducting utilization review or utilization management.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Decisions to approve, modify, or deny requests by providers for authorization prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of health care services to enrollees shall be communicated to the requesting provider within 24 hours of the decision.

Health care coverage: prior authorization.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides\nfor the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the\nDepartment of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a\ncrime. Existing law provides for the regulation of disability insurers by the\nDepartment of Insurance. Existing law generally authorizes a health care\nservice plan or disability insurer to use utilization review, under which a\nlicensed physician or a licensed health care professional who is competent to\nevaluate specific clinical issues may approve, modify, delay, or deny requests\nfor health care services based on medical necessity. For a request prior to or\nconcurrent with the provision of health care services, existing law requires\nutilization review decisions to be made within 5 business days from the plan's\nor insurer's receipt of the information reasonably necessary and requested by\nthe plan or insurer to make the determination, or within 72 hours if the\nenrollee or insured faces an imminent and serious threat to their health or\nthe normal timeframe would be detrimental to their life or health, as\nspecified.\n\nThis bill would shorten the timeline for prior _or concurrent_ authorization\nrequests to no more than 48 hours for standard requests or 24 hours for urgent\nrequests from the plan's or insurer's receipt of the information reasonably\nnecessary and requested by the plan or insurer to make the determination.\nBecause a willful violation of this provision by a health care service plan\nwould be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. Section 1367.01 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:\n\n1367.01. (a) A health care service plan and any entity with which it contracts\nfor services that include utilization review or utilization management\nfunctions, that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and\napproves, modifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical\nnecessity, requests by providers prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with\nthe provision of health care services to enrollees, or that delegates these\nfunctions to medical groups or independent practice associations or to other\ncontracting providers, shall comply with this section.\n\n(b) A health care service plan that is subject to this section shall have\nwritten policies and procedures establishing the process by which the plan\nprospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently reviews and approves,\nmodifies, delays, or denies, based in whole or in part on medical necessity,\nrequests by providers of health care services for plan enrollees. These\npolicies and procedures shall ensure that decisions based on the medical\nnecessity of proposed health care services are consistent with criteria or\nguidelines that are supported by clinical principles and processes.
