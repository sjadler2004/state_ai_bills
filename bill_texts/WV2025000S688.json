No warrant shall issue except upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched, or the person or thing to be searched.&quot; The Legislature finds further that innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence pose unique threats to the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The Legislature additionally finds that these innovations in surveillance and artificial intelligence recognition technology constitute a powerful tool that can be used to combat serious and organized crime, prevent fraud, identify victims, and protect citizens of West Virginia. The Legislature additionally recognizes that appropriate limitations and guardrails are required to ensure that government actors do not misuse facial recognition technology, including in any manner that would pose a threat to the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement&rsquo;s use of facial recognitions technological innovations in surveillance and the use of artificial intelligence int facial recognitions must be closely regulated in accordance with the provisions set forth in this article and subject to publicly available use policies that are developed in accordance with this article.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">The Legislature further finds and declares that foreign adversarial nations are actively engaged in seeking to harm the national security of the United States of America and the interests of the citizens of West Virginia, and that the foreign technology providers may utilize sub-contractors, employees, and agents from foreign adversarial countries to develop core technology. The Legislature finds that foreign technology providers in surveillance and artificial intelligence have frequently been coopted by foreign adversary governments; that surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology has the potential to access sensitive government data and investigative records, which, if accessed by foreign adversaries through an intentional security breach, would cause irreparable harm. The Legislature further finds that surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology may be used to implant back door system access or create security vulnerabilities in critical law enforcement systems. As such, the Legislature finds that foreign adversarial technology providers in facial recognition technology pose an immediate and material threat to the data security of the citizens of West Virginia, as well as to the national security of the United States of America. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that law enforcement&rsquo;s use of surveillance and artificial intelligence facial recognition technology must utilize American-developed technologies that are exclusively developed and manufactured in the United States.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;15-17-3.
