The bill would authorize the Attorney General, and the city attorney or county counsel in the jurisdiction in which the rental unit is located, to file a civil action for a violation of the bill, as specified, and would authorize a tenant to file a civil action for a violation of the bill by a landlord, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Housing rental rates and occupancy levels: algorithmic devices.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law governs the hiring of residential dwelling units and requires a landlord to provide specified notice to tenants prior to an increase in rent. Existing law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, prescribes statewide limits on the application of local rent control with regard to certain properties. That act, among other things, authorizes an owner of residential real property to establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a dwelling or unit that meets specified criteria, subject to certain limitations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make it unlawful for any person to sell, license, or otherwise provide to<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> a landlord an algorithmic device, as defined, that advises on rental rates or occupancy levels for residential dwelling units, and</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> 2 or more persons a rental pricing algorithm, as defined, with the intent that it be used by 2 or more persons, as specified, to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises.

The</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> premises if the person knew or should have known that another person in the same or related market used or will use the rental pricing algorithm to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises. The bill would also prohibit a person engaged in the business of providing a rental pricing algorithm that is used to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises and that is not otherwise prohibited under these provisions from using nonpublic competitor data, as defined, pertaining to residential premises in the state.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Existing law establishes the Attorney General as the head of the Department of Justice, with charge of all legal matters in which the state is interested, except as specified. Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts. Under existing law, a violation of the Cartwright Act is punishable as a crime. The Unfair Competition Law makes various practices unlawful and provides that a person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition is liable for a civil penalty, as specified.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> This</u> bill would authorize the Attorney General, and the city attorney or county counsel in the jurisdiction in which the rental unit is located, to file a civil action for a violation of the bill, as specified, and would authorize a<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> tenant</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> person</u> to file a civil action for a violation of the<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> bill by a landlord,</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> bill,</u> as specified.<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> The bill would provide that a violation of its provisions is an unlawful restraint on competition within the meaning of the Cartwright Act and an act of unfair competition in violation of the Unfair Competition Law. Because the bill would expand the scope of activities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is punishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">NO</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">YES</u> Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Housing rental rates and occupancy levels:\nalgorithmic devices.\n\nExisting law governs the hiring of residential dwelling units and requires a\nlandlord to provide specified notice to tenants prior to an increase in rent.\nExisting law, the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, prescribes statewide\nlimits on the application of local rent control with regard to certain\nproperties. That act, among other things, authorizes an owner of residential\nreal property to establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a\ndwelling or unit that meets specified criteria, subject to certain\nlimitations.\n\nThis bill would make it unlawful for any person to sell, license, or otherwise\nprovide to~~a landlord an algorithmic device, as defined, that advises on\nrental rates or occupancy levels for residential dwelling units, and~~ _2 or\nmore persons a rental pricing algorithm, as defined, with the intent that it\nbe used by 2 or more persons, as specified, to set rental rates, lease terms,\nor occupancy rates for residential premises. The bill_ would~~also~~ make it\nunlawful for~~a landlord~~ _any person_ to use~~an algorithmic device~~ _a\nrental pricing algorithm_ to set rental~~rates~~ _rates, lease terms,_ or\noccupancy levels for residential~~dwelling units. The~~ _premises if the\nperson knew or should have known that another person in the same or related\nmarket used or will use the rental pricing algorithm to set rental rates,\nlease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises. The bill would also\nprohibit a person engaged in the business of providing a rental pricing\nalgorithm that is used to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates\nfor residential premises and that is not otherwise prohibited under these\nprovisions from using nonpublic competitor data, as defined, pertaining to\nresidential premises in the state._\n\n_Existing law establishes the Attorney General as the head of the Department\nof Justice, with charge of all legal matters in which the state is interested,\nexcept as specified. Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney\nGeneral related to consumer protection, including, among others, the\nsupervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws.\nExisting law, known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are\nunlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts. Under existing law, a\nviolation of the Cartwright Act is punishable as a crime. The Unfair\nCompetition Law makes various practices unlawful and provides that a person\nwho engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition is\nliable for a civil penalty, as specified._\n\n_This_ bill would authorize the Attorney General, and the city attorney or\ncounty counsel in the jurisdiction in which the rental unit is located, to\nfile a civil action for a violation of the bill, as specified, and would\nauthorize a~~tenant~~ _person_ to file a civil action for a violation of\nthe~~bill by a landlord,~~ _bill,_ as specified._The bill would provide that a\nviolation of its provisions is an unlawful restraint on competition within the\nmeaning of the Cartwright Act and an act of unfair competition in violation of\nthe Unfair Competition Law. Because the bill would expand the scope of\nactivities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is\npunishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program._\n\n_The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies\nand school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory\nprovisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement._\n\n_This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason._\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\n~~NO~~ _YES_ Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual\nCurrent Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) Renters make up a larger share of households in California at 44 percent,\ncompared to the United States average of 35 percent, and California has a\nhigher percentage of renters compared to any other state other than New York,\nwhich has a rate of 46 percent.\n\n(b) California's median rent is two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800),\nwhich is 40 percent higher than the national median. In the City of Los\nAngeles, the median rent is two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800), while\nin the City and County of San Francisco, the median rent is three thousand two\nhundred eighty-five dollars ($3,285).\n\n(c) Recently, algorithmic pricing software has disrupted rental housing\nmarkets in cities nationwide.\n\n(d) Algorithmic pricing technology uses proprietary lease information to\ngather and share rent data, setting prices that can inflate rents and vacancy\nrates. The public sharing of vast amounts of proprietary data can harm renters\nby calculating and recommending rent and occupancy levels.\n\n(e) Algorithmic pricing software has led to double-digit rent increases,\nhigher vacancy rates, and more evictions, distorting markets by causing both\nrents and vacancy rates to rise simultaneously.\n\n(f) Often used by large corporate landlords, algorithmic pricing software\npromotes the consolidation of corporate and private equity ownership of rental\nhousing. This occurs at the expense of landlords, both large and small, who\nadhere to standard practices, thereby suppressing competition and creating an\nunfair market advantage.\n\n(g) Investigations have been launched recently into the use of algorithmic\npricing software. California and seven other states joined the United States\nDepartment of Justice's antitrust lawsuit, alleging that an algorithmic\nintermediary collects, combines, and exploits landlords' competitively\nsensitive information, causing renters to pay inflated prices.\n\n(h) Local governments in California have introduced ordinances to ban the use\nof algorithmic rent pricing software to protect renters from potential market\nmanipulations.\n\n~~SEC. 2. Section 1947.14 is added to the Civil Code, to read:~~\n\n~~1947.14.~~ _SEC. 2._\n\n_Section 1947.16 is added to the Civil Code, to read:_\n\n_1947.16._ (a) It is unlawful for any person to sell,

That act, among other things, authorizes an owner of residential real property to establish the initial and all subsequent rental rates for a dwelling or unit that meets specified criteria, subject to certain limitations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make it unlawful for any person to sell, license, or otherwise provide to 2 or more persons a rental pricing algorithm, as defined, with the intent that it be used by 2 or more persons, as specified, to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises. The bill would make it unlawful for any person to use a rental pricing algorithm to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy levels for residential premises if the person knew or should have known that another person in the same or related market used or will use the rental pricing algorithm to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises. The bill would also prohibit a person engaged in the business of providing a rental pricing algorithm that is used to set rental rates, lease terms, or occupancy rates for residential premises and that is not otherwise prohibited under these provisions from using nonpublic competitor data, as defined, pertaining to residential premises in the state.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law establishes the Attorney General as the head of the Department of Justice, with charge of all legal matters in which the state is interested, except as specified. Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts. Under existing law, a violation of the Cartwright Act is punishable as a crime. The Unfair Competition Law makes various practices unlawful and provides that a person who engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair competition is liable for a civil penalty, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> This bill would authorize the Attorney General, and the city attorney or county counsel in the jurisdiction in which the rental unit is located, to file a civil action for a violation of the bill, as specified, and would authorize a person<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> who is harmed by a violation of the bill</u> to file a civil<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> action for a violation of the bill,</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> action,</u> as specified. The bill would provide that a violation of its provisions is an unlawful restraint on competition within the meaning of the Cartwright Act and an act of unfair competition in violation of the Unfair Competition Law. Because the bill would expand the scope of activities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is punishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Renters make up a larger share of households in California at 44 percent, compared to the United States average of 35 percent, and California has a higher percentage of renters compared to any other state other than New York, which has a rate of 46 percent.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) California&#39;s median rent is two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800), which is 40 percent higher than the national median. In the City of Los Angeles, the median rent is two thousand eight hundred dollars ($2,800), while in the City and County of San Francisco, the median rent is three thousand two hundred eighty-five dollars ($3,285).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Recently, algorithmic pricing software has disrupted rental housing markets in cities nationwide.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Algorithmic pricing technology uses proprietary lease information to gather and share rent data, setting prices that can inflate rents and vacancy rates. The public sharing of vast amounts of proprietary data can harm renters by calculating and recommending rent and occupancy levels.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Algorithmic pricing software has led to double-digit rent increases, higher vacancy rates, and more evictions, distorting markets by causing both rents and vacancy rates to rise simultaneously.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Often used by large corporate landlords, algorithmic pricing software promotes the consolidation of corporate and private equity ownership of rental housing. This occurs at the expense of landlords, both large and small, who adhere to standard practices, thereby suppressing competition and creating an unfair market advantage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) Investigations have been launched recently into the use of algorithmic pricing software.

The public sharing of vast amounts of proprietary data can harm renters by calculating and recommending rent and occupancy levels.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Algorithmic pricing software has led to double-digit rent increases, higher vacancy rates, and more evictions, distorting markets by causing both rents and vacancy rates to rise simultaneously.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Often used by large corporate landlords, algorithmic pricing software promotes the consolidation of corporate and private equity ownership of rental housing. This occurs at the expense of landlords, both large and small, who adhere to standard practices, thereby suppressing competition and creating an unfair market advantage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) Investigations have been launched recently into the use of algorithmic pricing software.
