If signal strength metered by RF engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility operator has thirty (30) days to achieve compliance without disruption to performance of personal wireless services. The Rhode Island state police or deputies shall perform random testing from time to time to ensure facility compliance with this chapter.

Investigatory findings -- Responses._ ** _\n\n_As established in this chapter, scientific dimensions of SRM include the use\nof interoperable ground-based, airborne, and space-based facilities involving\nthe release of pollutants, including radiation. There are ever-increasing\nnumbers of pollution-generating, microwave-irradiating instruments used in\nweather experimentation including, but not limited to, ground-based facilities\ninteroperable with drones and satellites. Such infrastructures and the\nelectrical grid are vulnerable to radiation pollution interference, EMP events\nand cyber-attacks, potentially leading to accidents, fatalities, damage to\ncritical infrastructures, possible collapse of commerce systems and the\nfailure of essential public utilities, costing the state billions of dollars.\nTherefore, irradiating infrastructure shall be subject to evaluation by an\nindependent licensed radiofrequency (RF) engineer paid for by the facility\nowner. RF engineer shall provide findings in a report to be submitted to the\nRhode Island state police, therefore:_\n\n_(1) Radiation signal strength metered at the reported location is not to\nexceed -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or channel band specified\nby a transmitting entity 's FCC transmission license; or, maximum power output\nlimit from all frequencies/antennas from a wireless facility is not to exceed\n0.1 watt of effective radiated power (ERP) so as to provide -75 dBm signal\nstrength at 1/2 mile, or five (5) bars on a cell phone. If signal strength\nmetered by RF engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the\nfacility operator has thirty (30) days to achieve compliance without\ndisruption to performance of personal wireless services. The Rhode Island\nstate police or deputies shall perform random testing from time to time to\nensure facility compliance with this chapter. Failure to comply will result in\na fine of not less than five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) per day for\neach day the facility is out of compliance. Deliberate falsification or\naltering of information shall be punished in accordance with § 23-23.8-6(1)\nand (2). All public and private entities operating in the state shall comply\nwith these guidelines. _\n\n_(2) To reduce pollution and ensure the economic protection and privacy of\nRhode Islanders, the safe and secure deployment of hardwired, fiber-optic\nconnections to the premises (FTTP) to homes, schools, and businesses shall be\nrequired, thereby providing the ability to conduct financial transactions and\ncomplete lifesaving communications in the event that electronic interactions\nby existing means are compromised, hacked, restricted, or not possible. To\nsafeguard the wellbeing of Rhode Islanders, consumer choice options, including\nnon-wireless routers, non-wireless modems, and non-wireless mechanical analog\nutility meters, within home, property, or business shall be offered to\ncustomers without additional fees._\n\nSECTION 3. Section 30-15-7 of the General Laws in Chapter 30-15 entitled\n\"Emergency Management\" is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n**_30-15-7. Governor 's general powers._ **\n\nThe governor shall be responsible for carrying out the provisions of this\nchapter and shall be primarily responsible for emergency management in the\nstate.

The\ngovernor, from time to time, shall make recommendations to the general\nassembly, local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities\nas may facilitate measures for mitigation of the harmful consequences of\ndisasters;\n\n(4) Prepare a comprehensive plan and program for disasters (including response\nand recovery) in the state, the plan and program to be integrated into, and\ncoordinated with, the response and disaster plans of other states to the\nfullest possible extent, and coordinate the preparation of plans and programs\nfor disasters by the political subdivisions of the state, such plans to be\nintegrated into, and coordinated with the state disaster plan and program to\nthe fullest possible extent;\n\n(5) In accordance with the plans and programs for disasters in the state,\nprocure supplies and equipment, to institute training programs and public\ninformation programs, and to take all other preparatory steps, including the\npartial or full mobilization of disaster organizations in advance of actual\ndisaster, to ensure the furnishing of adequately trained and equipped forces\nof disaster personnel in time of need;\n\n(6) Delegate any administrative authority vested in the governor under this\nchapter and provide for the subsequent delegation of that authority; and\n\n(7) Do all other things necessary to ensure adequate preparation for disasters\nin the state, not inconsistent with other provisions of law.\n\nSECTION 4. This act shall take effect upon passage.\n\n**EXPLANATION**\n\n**BY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL**\n\n**OF**\n\n**AN ACT**\n\n**RELATING TO HEALTH AND SAFETY -- THE RHODE ISLAND CLEAN AIR PRESERVATION\nACT**\n\nThis act establishes the Rhode Island Clean Air Preservation Act that\nestablishes a regulatory process to prohibit polluting atmospheric\nexperimentation such as solar radiation modification (SRM), sunlight\nreflection methods (SRM), solar radiation management (SRM), geoengineering,\nweather modification, cloud seeding, or other atmospheric interventions\ninvolving the release of pollutants including Perfluoroalkyl and\nPolyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) known also as \"forever chemicals,\" within\nthe state, providing penalties for violations.\n\nThis act would take effect upon passage.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
