Health care coverage reporting.\n\nExisting law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, provides\nfor the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the\nDepartment of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a\ncrime.

Existing law\nauthorizes the director to make rules and regulations specifying the form and\ncontent of those reports and financial statements, as specified._\n\n_Existing law provides for the regulation of health insurers by the Department\nof Insurance and requires a health insurer or multiple employer welfare\narrangement (MEWA) to annually report specified information to the department.\nExisting law requires the Department of Insurance to publicly report the data\nprovided by each health insurer and MEWA on the department 's internet\nwebsite._\n\nThis bill would require the above-described reports to include specified\ninformation for each month,~~including~~ _including, among others,_ the total\nnumber of claims processed, adjudicated, denied, or partially denied.
