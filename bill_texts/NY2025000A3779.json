In no case shall the order direct payment of an amount less than the total wages, benefits or wage supplements found by the commissioner to be due, plus the liquidated damages in the amount of one hundred percent of unpaid wages, the appropriate civil penalty, and interest at the rate of interest then in effect, as prescribed by the superintendent of financial services pursuant to section fourteen-a of the banking law per annum from the date of the underpayment to the date of the payment.

In assessing the amount of the penalty, the commissioner shall give\ndue consideration to the size of the employer's business, the good faith basis\nof the employer to believe that its conduct was in compliance with the law,\nthe gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and, in the\ncase of wages, benefits or supplements violations, the failure to comply with\nrecordkeeping or other non-wage requirements.\n\nSection 3.
