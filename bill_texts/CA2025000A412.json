Existing federal law generally gives the owner of the copyright the right to reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords and the right to distribute copies or phonorecords of the work to the public. Existing federal law provides that sound recordings fixed before February 15, 1972, are not subject to copyright, but are subject to similar rights and protections under the Classics Protection and Access Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires, on or before January 1, 2026, and before each time thereafter that a generative artificial intelligence system or service, as defined, or a substantial modification to a generative artificial intelligence system or service, released on or after January 1, 2022, is made available to Californians for use, regardless of whether the terms of that use include compensation, a developer of the system or service to post on the developer&#39;s internet website documentation, as specified, regarding the data used to train the generative artificial intelligence system or service.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require a developer of a generative artificial intelligence model to, among other things, document any covered materials that the developer knows were used<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> by the developer</u> to train the model.
