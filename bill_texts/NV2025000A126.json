(NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, <b>sections 2 and 3</b> of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography involving: (1) images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence; and (2) artificial intelligence-generated minors.<b>Section 1</b> of this bill defines the term &quot;artificial intelligence-generated minor&quot; for purposes of these prohibitions and certain other provisions of existing law relating to pornography involving minors to mean a fictional human that: (1) is generated through the use of artificial intelligence; and (2) has anatomical or physical features that make the fictional human appear to be a minor.<b>Section 1</b> also defines certain other terms for the same purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B felony. (NRS 200.725) <b>Section 2</b> expands this prohibition to include any item or material that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) <b>Section 3</b> expands this prohibition to include any film, photograph or other visual presentation that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct. <b>Section 15</b> of this bill makes conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by <b>section 3</b>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445, 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving pornography and a minor, <b>section 21</b> has the effect of requiring a person convicted of a violation of <b>section 2 or 3</b> to: (1) register as a sex offender under certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to sex offenders. <b>Sections 4-14 and 16-25</b> of this bill make conforming changes to certain provisions that refer to offenses involving pornography and a minor to make such provisions also refer to certain offenses involving pornography and an artificial-intelligence generated minor.</p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"center\">THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Section 1.</b> NRS 200.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">200.700 As used in NRS 200.700 to 200.760, inclusive, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&quot;Artificial intelligence-generated minor&quot;

(BDR\n15-195)\n\nFISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.\n\nEffect on the State: Yes.\n\nAN ACT relating to criminal justice; expanding certain prohibitions relating\nto pornography involving minors; providing penalties; and providing other\nmatters properly relating thereto.\n\n**Legislative Counsel 's Digest:**\n\nExisting law prohibits a person from committing certain acts regarding\npornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, **sections 2\nand 3** of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography\ninvolving: (1) images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial\nintelligence; and (2) artificial intelligence-generated minors.**Section 1**\nof this bill defines the term \"artificial intelligence-generated minor\" for\npurposes of these prohibitions and certain other provisions of existing law\nrelating to pornography involving minors to mean a fictional human that: (1)\nis generated through the use of artificial intelligence; and (2) has\nanatomical or physical features that make the fictional human appear to be a\nminor.**Section 1** also defines certain other terms for the same purpose.\n\nExisting law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or\ndistributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or\nsimulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is\nguilty of a category B felony. (NRS 200.725) **Section 2** expands this\nprohibition to include any item or material that contains or incorporates: (1)\nan image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict\nthe minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or\nsimulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial\nintelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to\nengage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.\n\nExisting law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or\nher possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a\nperson under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or\nengaging in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual\nconduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a\ncategory A felony for any subsequent offense.

(NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, <b>sections 2 and 3</b> of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography involving: (1) images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial intelligence; and (2) artificial intelligence-generated minors.<b>Section 1</b> of this bill defines the term &quot;artificial intelligence-generated minor&quot; for purposes of these prohibitions and certain other provisions of existing law relating to pornography involving minors to mean a fictional human that: (1) is generated through the use of artificial intelligence; and (2) has anatomical or physical features that make the fictional human appear to be a minor.<b>Section 1</b> also defines certain other terms for the same purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or distributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of a category B felony. (NRS 200.725) <b>Section 2</b> expands this prohibition to include any item or material that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or her possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) <b>Section 3</b> expands this prohibition to include any film, photograph or other visual presentation that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct. <b>Section 15</b> of this bill makes conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by <b>section 3</b>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a sex offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441, 179D.445, 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the purposes of these requirements to include any offense involving pornography and a minor. (NRS 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability of offenses involving pornography and a minor, <b>section 21</b> has the effect of requiring a person convicted of a violation of <b>section 2 or 3</b> to: (1) register as a sex offender under certain circumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to sex offenders. <b>Sections 4-14 and 16-25</b> of this bill make conforming changes to certain provisions that refer to offenses involving pornography and a minor to make such provisions also refer to certain offenses involving pornography and an artificial-intelligence generated minor.</p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"center\">THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Section 1.</b> NRS 200.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">200.700 As used in NRS 200.700 to 200.760, inclusive, unless the context otherwise requires:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&quot;Artificial intelligence-generated minor&quot;

(BDR\n15-195)\n\nFISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: No.\n\nEffect on the State: Yes.\n\nAN ACT relating to criminal justice; expanding certain prohibitions relating\nto pornography involving minors; providing penalties; and providing other\nmatters properly relating thereto.\n\n**Legislative Counsel 's Digest:**\n\nExisting law prohibits a person from committing certain acts regarding\npornography involving minors. (NRS 200.700-200.760) In general, **sections 2\nand 3** of this bill expand these prohibitions to include pornography\ninvolving: (1) images of minors that have been manipulated using artificial\nintelligence; and (2) artificial intelligence-generated minors.**Section 1**\nof this bill defines the term \"artificial intelligence-generated minor\" for\npurposes of these prohibitions and certain other provisions of existing law\nrelating to pornography involving minors to mean a fictional human that: (1)\nis generated through the use of artificial intelligence; and (2) has\nanatomical or physical features that make the fictional human appear to be a\nminor.**Section 1** also defines certain other terms for the same purpose.\n\nExisting law provides that a person who knowingly prepares, advertises or\ndistributes any item or material that depicts a minor engaging in or\nsimulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is\nguilty of a category B felony. (NRS 200.725) **Section 2** expands this\nprohibition to include any item or material that contains or incorporates: (1)\nan image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered to depict\nthe minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or\nsimulate, sexual conduct; or (2) an obscene depiction of an artificial\nintelligence-generated minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to\nengage in or simulate, certain sexual conduct.\n\nExisting law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or\nher possession any film, photograph or other visual representation depicting a\nperson under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or\nengaging in, simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual\nconduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a\ncategory A felony for any subsequent offense. (NRS 200.730) **Section 3**\nexpands this prohibition to include any film, photograph or other visual\npresentation that contains or incorporates: (1) an image of a minor that has\nbeen mechanically or digitally altered to depict the minor engaging in or\nsimulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or\n(2) an obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor as the\nsubject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in or simulating, or assisting\nothers to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct. **Section 15** of this bill\nmakes conforming changes to refer to provisions that have been renumbered by\n**section 3**.\n\nExisting law requires a person convicted of a sexual offense to register as a\nsex offender and comply with certain other requirements. (NRS 179D.441,\n179D.445, 179D.460) Existing law defines the term sexual offense for the\npurposes of these requirements to include any offense involving pornography\nand a minor. (NRS 179D.097) Because sections 2 and 3 expand the applicability\nof offenses involving pornography and a minor, **section 21** has the effect\nof requiring a person convicted of a violation of **section 2 or 3** to: (1)\nregister as a sex offender under certain circumstances; and (2) comply with\ncertain other requirements applicable to sex offenders. **Sections 4-14 and\n16-25** of this bill make conforming changes to certain provisions that refer\nto offenses involving pornography and a minor to make such provisions also\nrefer to certain offenses involving pornography and an artificial-intelligence\ngenerated minor.\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO\nENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n**Section 1.** NRS 200.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n200.700 As used in NRS 200.700 to 200.760, inclusive, unless the context\notherwise requires:\n\n1\\. _\" Artificial intelligence-generated minor\" means a fictional human that:_\n\n_(a) Is generated through the use of artificial intelligence; and_\n\n_(b) Has anatomical or physical features that make the fictional human appear\nto be a minor._\n\n_2. \"Community\" means the area from which a jury is or would be selected for\nthe court in which the action is tried._\n\n_3. \"Obscene\" means any item or material which:_\n\n_(a) An average person applying contemporary adult community standards would\nfind, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest; and_\n\n_(b) Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or\nscientific value._\n\n_4._ \"Performance\" means any play, film, photograph, computer-generated image,\nelectronic representation, dance or other visual presentation.\n\n~~2.~~ _5._ \"Promote\" means to produce, direct, procure, manufacture, sell,\ngive, lend, publish, distribute, exhibit, advertise or possess for the purpose\nof distribution.\n\n~~3.~~ _6._ \"Sexual conduct\" means sexual intercourse, lewd exhibition of the\ngenitals, fellatio, cunnilingus, bestiality, anal intercourse, excretion,\nsado-masochistic abuse, masturbation, or the penetration of any part of a\nperson's body or of any object manipulated or inserted by a person into the\ngenital or anal opening of the body of another.\n\n~~4.~~ _7._ \"Sexual portrayal\" means the depiction of a person in a manner\nwhich appeals to the prurient interest in sex and which does not have serious\nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\n**Sec. 2.** NRS 200.725 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n200.725 _1._ A person ~~who~~ _shall not_ knowingly ~~prepares, advertises~~\n_prepare, advertise_ or ~~distributes~~ _distribute_ any item or material that\n~~depicts~~ _:_\n\n_(a) Depicts_ a minor engaging in, or simulating, or assisting others to\nengage in or simulate, sexual conduct _; or_\n\n_(b) Contains or incorporates, in any manner, an:_\n\n_(1) Image of a minor that has been mechanically or digitally altered,\nincluding, without limitation, through the use of artificial intelligence, to\ndepict the minor engaging in or simulating, or assisting others to engage in\nor simulate, sexual conduct; or_\n\n_(2) Obscene depiction of an artificial intelligence-generated minor engaging\nin or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual\nconduct._\n\n_2\\.
