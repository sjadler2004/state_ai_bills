(NRS 200.725) <b>Section 2</b> of this bill expands this prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. <b>Section 2</b> also revises the applicable criminal penalties by: (1) subjecting each person found guilty of violating the prohibition to a term of imprisonment in state prison; (2) providing that a person who is found guilty of a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a category A felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 10 years and a maximum term of life with the possibility of parole; and (3) providing that a person who is found guilty of a violation of <b>section 2</b> may not be convicted of a violation of <b>section 3</b> of this bill for possessing the same material.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or her possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any subsequent offense.

(NRS 200.725) <b>Section 2</b>of this bill expands this prohibition to include computer-generated child pornography. <b>Section 2</b> also revises the applicable criminal penalties by: (1) providing that a person who is found guilty of a second or subsequent violation is guilty of a category A felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 10 years and a maximum term of life with the possibility of parole; and (2) providing that a person who is found guilty of a violation of <b>section 2</b> may not be convicted of a violation of <b>section 3</b> of this bill for possessing the same material.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or her possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a person under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a category A felony for any subsequent offense.

(NRS 200.725)\n**Section 2** of this bill expands this prohibition to include computer-\ngenerated child pornography. **Section 2** also revises the applicable\ncriminal penalties by: (1) providing that a person who is found guilty of a\nsecond or subsequent violation is guilty of a category A felony, punishable by\nimprisonment in the state prison for a minimum term of not less than 10 years\nand a maximum term of life with the possibility of parole; and (2) providing\nthat a person who is found guilty of a violation of **section 2** may not be\nconvicted of a violation of **section 3** of this bill for possessing the same\nmaterial.\n\nExisting law provides that a person who knowingly and willfully has in his or\nher possession any film, photograph or other visual presentation depicting a\nperson under the age of 16 years as the subject of a sexual portrayal or\nengaging in, simulating or assisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual\nconduct is guilty of: (1) a category B felony for the first offense; and (2) a\ncategory A felony for any subsequent offense.

(NRS 179D.097) Because **sections 2 and 3** expand the\napplicability of offenses involving pornography and a minor, **sections 2 and\n3** have the effect of requiring a person convicted of a violation of\n**section 2 or 3** to: (1) register as a sex offender under certain\ncircumstances; and (2) comply with certain other requirements applicable to\nsex offenders. **Section 1** of this bill defines certain terms for the\npurposes of **sections 2 and 3**.\n\n**Section 4** of this bill makes a conforming change that is necessary to\nreflect the revision to the organization of existing law made by **section\n3**.\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO\nENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n**Section 1.** NRS 200.700 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n200.700 As used in NRS 200.700 to 200.760, inclusive, unless the context\notherwise requires:\n\n1\\. _\" Computer-generated child pornography\" means:_\n\n_(a) Any visual depiction of:_\n\n_(1) An actual child that has been created, adapted or modified to depict the\nchild as the subject of a sexual portrayal or engaging in, or simulating, or\nassisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct; or_\n\n_(2) An actual person who is 18 years of age or older that has been created,\nadapted or modified to depict the person as a child and:_\n\n_(I) As the subject of a sexual portrayal; or_\n\n_(II) Engaging in, or simulating, or assisting others to engage in or\nsimulate, sexual conduct; or_\n\n_(b) Any visual representation that appears to depict a child as the subject\nof a sexual portrayal or engaging in, or simulating, or assisting others to\nengage in or simulate, sexual conduct, if the representation is:_\n\n_(1) Created by the use of artificial intelligence or other computer\ntechnology capable of processing and interpreting specific data inputs to\ncreate a visual depiction; and_\n\n_(2) Indistinguishable from a minor._\n\n_2. \"Indistinguishable\" means virtually indistinguishable, such that an\nordinary person viewing the visual depiction would conclude that the visual\ndepiction is of an actual minor._\n\n_3._ \"Performance\" means any play, film, photograph, computer-generated image,\nelectronic representation, dance or other visual presentation.\n\n~~2.~~ _4._ \"Promote\" means to produce, direct, procure, manufacture, sell,\ngive, lend, publish, distribute, exhibit, advertise or possess for the purpose\nof distribution.\n\n~~3.~~ _5._ \"Sexual conduct\" means sexual intercourse, lewd exhibition of the\ngenitals, fellatio, cunnilingus, bestiality, anal intercourse, excretion,\nsado-masochistic abuse, masturbation, or the penetration of any part of a\nperson's body or of any object manipulated or inserted by a person into the\ngenital or anal opening of the body of another.\n\n~~4.~~ _6._ \"Sexual portrayal\" means the depiction of a person in a manner\nwhich appeals to the prurient interest in sex and which does not have serious\nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\n**Sec. 2.** NRS 200.725 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n200.725 _1._ A person ~~who~~ _shall not_ knowingly ~~prepares, advertises~~\n_prepare, advertise_ or ~~distributes any item~~ _distribute any:_\n\n_(a) Item_ or material that depicts a minor engaging in, or simulating, or\nassisting others to engage in or simulate, sexual conduct _; or_\n\n_(b) Computer-generated child pornography._\n\n_2\\.
