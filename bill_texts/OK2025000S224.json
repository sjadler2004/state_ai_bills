NEW LAW A new section of law not to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes reads as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure educational excellence in this state by making informed decisions in support of students in this state, their education, and the future contributions they will make to the workforce.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The Legislature finds that a responsible government ensures that taxpayer dollars are expended in the manner directed by the Legislature and are providing a return on investment for Oklahoma&#39;s future.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. To protect the hard-earned dollars of taxpayers in this state, the Legislature must be able to comprehensively evaluate student and workforce data to make decisions and reforms where necessary while safeguarding the confidential information of Oklahomans.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2. NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 3-180 of Title 70, unless there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. There is hereby created the Oklahoma Education and Workforce Efficiency Data System (EDS) as a secure system for the de-identification, exchange, and matching of education and workforce data among approved entities. The purpose of the EDS shall be to provide state agencies, legislators, and other approved users with access to de-identified data on early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, workforce training, and employment outcomes to improve education and workforce outcomes and increase the return on investment for taxpayer funds.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B.

Access, ingest, integrate, and transform a variety of data types to and from the Oklahoma Workforce Commission, the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education, the State Department of Education, the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission (OESC), the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the Regional University System of Oklahoma (RUSO), the Office of Educational Quality and Accountability (OEQA), and any other agency that collects critical employment or education data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. Be designed to allow additional agencies to integrate their data in the future;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. Implement identity management capabilities to create unique identifiers to restrict personally identifiable information while linking early childhood education, elementary and secondary education, postsecondary education, and workforce data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">4. Enable data governance, auditing, and tracking of data edits and changes by authorized users;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">5.

Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 as reauthorized by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, the Workforce Data Quality Initiative, and other workforce-and education-related federal grant programs. Any data used for such purposes shall be de-identified or aggregated before submission, unless federal law explicitly requires otherwise; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3.

The EDS shall provide controlled access to approved external partners including researchers or vendors, ensuring compliance with privacy protections. Data access shall be granted through a formal data-sharing agreement submitted to the Efficiency Data System Governance Council created pursuant to Section 3 of this act, with guidelines on usage and restrictions to safeguard personally identifiable information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 3.
