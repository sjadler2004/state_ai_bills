TORRES -- read once and referred to the Committee on\nEducation -- committee discharged, bill amended, ordered reprinted as amended\nand recommitted to said committee\n\nAN ACT to amend the education law, in relation to establishing an artificial\nintelligence literacy digital equity competitive grant program\n\n**The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do\nenact as follows:**\n\nSection 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the\n\"Artificial Intelligence Literacy Act\".\n\nSection 2. Legislative findings. The legislature, as well as the United States\ncongress, finds that:\n\n(1) Artificial intelligence is transformative technology.\n\n(2) Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly ubiquitous making\nartificial intelligence literacy important.\n\n(3) Technological leadership in artificial intelligence is an economic and\nnational security imperative.\n\n(4) Effective artificial intelligence literacy initiatives encompass not only\ntechnical training but also comprehensive education about the potential\nbenefits and risks.\n\n(5) Informed developers and consumers of artificial intelligence technologies\ncan help mitigate risks and biases often found in systems that use artificial\nintelligence.\n\n(6) Basic artificial intelligence literacy is critical to ensuring Americans\nhave the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the economy and digital world.\n\n(7) Successful artificial intelligence literacy initiatives will prepare\nAmericans of all ages and technical backgrounds to safely navigate artificial\nintelligence tools and artificial intelligence-enabled technologies.\n\n(8) Communities most negatively impacted by artificial intelligenceenabled\ntechnologies often have the least access to artificial intelligence education.\n\n(9) Artificial intelligence literacy initiatives must engage stakeholders and\ncommunities in all stages and specific outreach efforts should be made for\ncommunities disproportionately impacted by the digital divide, including\nminority and rural communities.\n\n(10) Jobs for the Future survey found 58% believe that learning opportunities\naround artificial intelligence should be offered to workers, 53% believe such\nopportunities should be available to learners, 54% believe they would feel\nmore prepared for the future impact of artificial intelligence if they were\ngiven learning tools for it.\n\n(11) As of 2018, the U.S. artificial intelligence workforce stood at about\n14,000,000 workers or 9% of employment. Demand for artificial intelligence\noccupations is projected to grow twice as fast as for all occupations in the\nU.S.\n\n(12) In 2021, black students made up only 7.5% of artificial intelligence-\nrelated bachelor's degrees despite making up 14% of the population. Women\naccount for 60% of college graduates and only 40% of STEM graduates and 25% of\nartificial intelligence graduates.\n\n(13) The need for a strong workforce of artificial intelligence workers, as\nwell an artificial intelligence-literate population, requires investment in\nartificial intelligence literacy education.\n\n(14) Artificial intelligence literacy must also encompass ethical and\nresponsible use of emerging technologies. Preparing students from an early age\nto critically engage with artificial intelligence is essential for cultivating\na digitally literate, civically informed, and workforce-ready society.\n\n(15) Public investment in early-stage artificial intelligence education will\nexpand access to opportunity, foster equity, and ensure New York remains at\nthe forefront of technological leadership.\n\nSection 3. The education law is amended by adding a new section 115 to read as\nfollows:\n\n_Section 115. Artificial intelligence literacy in the digital equity\ncompetitive grant program. 1. Definitions.
