and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, North Carolina has intolerably high healthcare costs, with recent studies ranking the State 50th out of 50 in the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, skyrocketing healthcare costs have resulted in over 40 percent of Americans reporting some type of healthcare debt, according to one study; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, many patients face unexpected medical bills due to a lack of disclosure about out-of-network providers and a general lack of transparency in healthcare pricing, resulting in financial strain and hardship; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, employers are burdened with the increasing costs of providing health insurance for employees, leading to higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, patients and employers are often unable to compare the costs of medical services due to a lack of clear and accessible pricing information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, the absence of price transparency in the healthcare system leads to market inefficiencies, less awareness of price difference, less competition, and higher prices, with consumers often unable to identify the most cost-effective providers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, transparency in healthcare pricing allows consumers to shop for affordable healthcare services and encourages competition among healthcare providers to offer more competitive pricing; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, providing consumers with clear, understandable, and accessible information about the costs of healthcare services will foster a more competitive and patient-centered healthcare market; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, requiring healthcare providers and insurers to disclose their prices in advance, including all providers and services a patient may need, both in-network and out-of-network, will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their care, leading to better healthcare outcomes at lower costs; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, price transparency will incentivize hospitals and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care while reducing prices, to the benefit of patients and employers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, clear pricing and competition among healthcare providers will encourage innovation in healthcare delivery and improve overall efficiency within the system; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, empowering patients and employers with pricing information will help create a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability, access, and choice; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to make healthcare prices transparent, &quot;empower[ing] patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information,&quot; also &quot;ensur[ing] hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription drug prices; Now, therefore,</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>PART I.

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, North Carolina has intolerably high healthcare costs, with recent studies ranking the State 50th out of 50 in the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, skyrocketing healthcare costs have resulted in over 40 percent of Americans reporting some type of healthcare debt, according to one study; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, many patients face unexpected medical bills due to a lack of disclosure about out-of-network providers and a general lack of transparency in healthcare pricing, resulting in financial strain and hardship; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, employers are burdened with the increasing costs of providing health insurance for employees, leading to higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, patients and employers are often unable to compare the costs of medical services due to a lack of clear and accessible pricing information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, the absence of price transparency in the healthcare system leads to market inefficiencies, less awareness of price difference, less competition, and higher prices, with consumers often unable to identify the most cost-effective providers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, transparency in healthcare pricing allows consumers to shop for affordable healthcare services and encourages competition among healthcare providers to offer more competitive pricing; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, providing consumers with clear, understandable, and accessible information about the costs of healthcare services will foster a more competitive and patient-centered healthcare market; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, requiring healthcare providers and insurers to disclose their prices in advance, including all providers and services a patient may need, both in-network and out-of-network, will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their care, leading to better healthcare outcomes at lower costs; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, price transparency will incentivize hospitals and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care while reducing prices, to the benefit of patients and employers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, clear pricing and competition among healthcare providers will encourage innovation in healthcare delivery and improve overall efficiency within the system; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, empowering patients and employers with pricing information will help create a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability, access, and choice; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to make healthcare prices transparent, &quot;empower[ing] patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information,&quot; also &quot;ensur[ing] hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription drug prices; Now, therefore,</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>PART I.

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, North Carolina has intolerably high healthcare costs, with recent studies ranking the State 50th out of 50 in the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, skyrocketing healthcare costs have resulted in over 40 percent of Americans reporting some type of healthcare debt, according to one study; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, many patients face unexpected medical bills due to a lack of disclosure about out-of-network providers and a general lack of transparency in healthcare pricing, resulting in financial strain and hardship; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, employers are burdened with the increasing costs of providing health insurance for employees, leading to higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, patients and employers are often unable to compare the costs of medical services due to a lack of clear and accessible pricing information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, the absence of price transparency in the healthcare system leads to market inefficiencies, less awareness of price difference, less competition, and higher prices, with consumers often unable to identify the most cost-effective providers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, transparency in healthcare pricing allows consumers to shop for affordable healthcare services and encourages competition among healthcare providers to offer more competitive pricing; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, providing consumers with clear, understandable, and accessible information about the costs of healthcare services will foster a more competitive and patient-centered healthcare market; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, requiring healthcare providers and insurers to disclose their prices in advance, including all providers and services a patient may need, both in-network and out-of-network, will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their care, leading to better healthcare outcomes at lower costs; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, price transparency will incentivize hospitals and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care while reducing prices, to the benefit of patients and employers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, clear pricing and competition among healthcare providers will encourage innovation in healthcare delivery and improve overall efficiency within the system; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, empowering patients and employers with pricing information will help create a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability, access, and choice; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to make healthcare prices transparent, &quot;empower[ing] patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information,&quot; also &quot;ensur[ing] hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription drug prices; Now, therefore,</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>PART I.

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, North Carolina has intolerably high healthcare costs, with recent studies ranking the State 50th out of 50 in the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, skyrocketing healthcare costs have resulted in over 40 percent of Americans reporting some type of healthcare debt, according to one study; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, many patients face unexpected medical bills due to a lack of disclosure about out-of-network providers and a general lack of transparency in healthcare pricing, resulting in financial strain and hardship; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, employers are burdened with the increasing costs of providing health insurance for employees, leading to higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, patients and employers are often unable to compare the costs of medical services due to a lack of clear and accessible pricing information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, the absence of price transparency in the healthcare system leads to market inefficiencies, less awareness of price difference, less competition, and higher prices, with consumers often unable to identify the most cost-effective providers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, transparency in healthcare pricing allows consumers to shop for affordable healthcare services and encourages competition among healthcare providers to offer more competitive pricing; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, providing consumers with clear, understandable, and accessible information about the costs of healthcare services will foster a more competitive and patient-centered healthcare market; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, requiring healthcare providers and insurers to disclose their prices in advance, including all providers and services a patient may need, both in-network and out-of-network, will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their care, leading to better healthcare outcomes at lower costs; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, price transparency will incentivize hospitals and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care while reducing prices, to the benefit of patients and employers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, clear pricing and competition among healthcare providers will encourage innovation in healthcare delivery and improve overall efficiency within the system; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, empowering patients and employers with pricing information will help create a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability, access, and choice; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to make healthcare prices transparent, &quot;empower[ing] patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information,&quot; also &quot;ensur[ing] hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription drug prices; Now, therefore,</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>PART I.

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, North Carolina has intolerably high healthcare costs, with recent studies ranking the State 50th out of 50 in the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, skyrocketing healthcare costs have resulted in over 40 percent of Americans reporting some type of healthcare debt, according to one study; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, many patients face unexpected medical bills due to a lack of disclosure about out-of-network providers and a general lack of transparency in healthcare pricing, resulting in financial strain and hardship; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, employers are burdened with the increasing costs of providing health insurance for employees, leading to higher premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, patients and employers are often unable to compare the costs of medical services due to a lack of clear and accessible pricing information, hindering their ability to make informed decisions; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, the absence of price transparency in the healthcare system leads to market inefficiencies, less awareness of price difference, less competition, and higher prices, with consumers often unable to identify the most cost-effective providers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, transparency in healthcare pricing allows consumers to shop for affordable healthcare services and encourages competition among healthcare providers to offer more competitive pricing; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, providing consumers with clear, understandable, and accessible information about the costs of healthcare services will foster a more competitive and patient-centered healthcare market; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, requiring healthcare providers and insurers to disclose their prices in advance, including all providers and services a patient may need, both in-network and out-of-network, will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their care, leading to better healthcare outcomes at lower costs; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, price transparency will incentivize hospitals and healthcare providers to improve the quality of care while reducing prices, to the benefit of patients and employers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, clear pricing and competition among healthcare providers will encourage innovation in healthcare delivery and improve overall efficiency within the system; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, empowering patients and employers with pricing information will help create a healthcare system that prioritizes affordability, access, and choice; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Whereas, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order to make healthcare prices transparent, &quot;empower[ing] patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information,&quot; also &quot;ensur[ing] hospitals and insurers disclose actual prices, not estimates, and take action to make prices comparable across hospitals and insurers, including prescription drug prices; Now, therefore,</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>PART I.
