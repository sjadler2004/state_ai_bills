A developer\nmay include a description of the functional need or desired purpose of the\nsynthetic data in relation to the intended purpose of the system or service.\n\n(b) For purposes of this subsection, the following definitions apply:\n\n(i) As applied to datasets that include labels, \"types of data points\" means\nthe types of labels used; and\n\n(ii) As applied to datasets without labeling, \"types of data points\" refers to\nthe general characteristics.\n\n(2) A developer is not required to post documentation regarding the data used\nto train a generative artificial intelligence system or service for any of the\nfollowing:\n\n(a) A generative artificial intelligence system or service whose sole purpose\nis to help ensure security and integrity;\n\n(b) A generative artificial intelligence system or service whose sole purpose\nis the operation of aircraft in the national airspace; and\n\n(c) A generative artificial intelligence system or service developed for\nnational security, military, or defense purposes that is made available only\nto a federal entity.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 3. The attorney general shall enforce this chapter, and a\ndeveloper who is found in violation of this chapter is liable for a civil\npenalty in the amount of $5,000 per violation to be collected in a civil\naction filed by the attorney general.
