Whenever AI device performance concerns are\nidentified, deployers shall implement appropriate corrective actions to\nmitigate risk to patients.\n\nD. All documentation shall comply with state and federal medical record-\nkeeping requirements and be accessible for regulatory review. Documentation of\nrelevant instances where a qualified end-user overrides or disagrees with AI\ndevice-generated outputs must be maintained through a summary report\nindicating the frequency and nature of overrides. Deployers shall document the\npercentage or number of such overrides or disagreements.\n\nSECTION 4.

Deployers of any artificial intelligence (AI) device shall establish an AI\ngovernance group with representation from qualified end-users. This governance\ngroup is responsible for overseeing compliance with this act.\n\nB. Deployers shall maintain an updated inventory of deployed AI devices, with\ndevice instructions for use and any relevant safety and effectiveness\ndocumentation made accessible to all qualified end-users of the device.\n\nC. Deployers of AI devices shall ensure compliance with all requirements\nherein, as well as with applicable federal and state security, privacy, and\nnondiscrimination regulations. Noncompliance will result in penalties set by\nthe State Department of Health, which shall have the authority to enforce and\nmake rules to enforce this act.\n\nD. Deployers shall have a diligent review and selection process for the\ndeployed AI device.\n\nE. Deployers shall document the use case and user training procedure for the\nAI device.\n\nF. Deployers shall continuously monitor the performance of all deployed AI\ndevices, including assessing any impact on patient safety or the quality of\npatient care.\n\nG. In conducting performance monitoring described in subsection F of this\nsection, deployers must participate in national specialty society-administered\nartificial intelligence assessment registries when feasible.\n\nSECTION 5.
