A civil action for private enforcement of the provisions of the Voice and Visual Likeness Rights Act may be brought within three years after the date on which the party bringing the civil action discovered or with due diligence should have discovered the violation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">I. It shall not be a defense that the defendant displayed or otherwise communicated to the public a disclaimer stating that the applicable digital replica was unauthorized or disclosing that the digital replica was generated through the use of artificial intelligence or other technology.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">J.

The plaintiff may seek injunctive or other equitable relief.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">L. In the case of willful activity in which the injured party has proven that the defendant acted with malice, fraud, knowledge or willful avoidance of knowledge that the conduct violated the law, the court may award to the injured party punitive damages; and if the prevailing party is the party:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) bringing the court action, the court may award reasonable attorney fees; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) defending the court action, the court may award reasonable attorney fees if the court determines that the action was not brought in good faith.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">M. An online service that has an objectively reasonable belief that material claimed to be an unauthorized digital replica does not qualify as a digital replica pursuant to the Voice and Visual Likeness Rights Act shall not be liable for statutory or actual damages exceeding one million dollars ($1,000,000), regardless of whether the material is determined to be an unauthorized digital replica.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">N. In the event that the third party that provided the material that the online service has removed or to which the online service has disabled access files a lawsuit against the sender of a notice of violation claiming that the notice was false or deceptive, the online service may restore the removed material to its network for access by members of the public without monetary liability to either the notice sender or the third party that provided the material that the online service had removed or disabled access.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 8.
