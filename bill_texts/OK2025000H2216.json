NEW LAW A new section of law to be codified in the Oklahoma Statutes as Section 1000 of Title 71, unless there is created a duplication in numbering, reads as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. As used in this act:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. &quot;Person&quot; means any individual, firm, association, partnership, corporation, joint stock company, syndicate, receiver, common law trust, conservator, statutory trust, or any other concern by whatever name known or however organized, formed, or created, and includes not-for-profit corporations, associations, educational and religious institutions, political parties, community, civic, or other organizations; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. &quot;Voice&quot; means a sound in a medium that is readily identifiable and attributable to a particular individual, regardless of whether the sound contains the actual voice or a simulation of the voice of the individual.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Every individual has a property right in the use of that individual&#39;s name, photograph, voice, or likeness in any medium in any manner. These property rights are freely assignable and licensable, and do not expire upon the death of the individual so protected, whether or not such rights were commercially exploited by the individual during the individual&#39;s lifetime, but shall be descendible to the executors, assigns, heirs, or devisees of the individual so protected by this act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. 1. The rights provided for in subsection B of this section shall be deemed exclusive to the individual, subject to the assignment or licensing of such rights as provided in subsection B of this section, during such individual&#39;s lifetime and to the executors, heirs, assigns, or devisees for a period of ten (10) years after the death of the individual.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. Commercial exploitation of the property right by any executor, assignee, heir, or devisee if the individual is deceased shall maintain the right as the exclusive property of the executor, assignee, heir, or devisee until such right is terminated as provided in this paragraph. The exclusive right to commercial exploitation of the property rights is terminated by proof of the non-use of the name, photograph, voice, or likeness of an individual for commercial purposes by an executor, assignee, heir, or devisee to the use for a period of two (2) years subsequent to the initial period of ten (10) years following the individual&#39;s death. For purposes of this paragraph, &quot;use&quot; includes the commercial availability of a sound recording or audiovisual work in which the individual&#39;s name, photograph, voice, or likeness is readily identifiable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. Any person who knowingly uses or infringes upon the use of an individual&#39;s name, photograph, voice, or likeness in any medium, in any manner directed to any person other than such individual, for purposes of advertising products, merchandise, goods, or services, or for purposes of fundraising, solicitation of donations, purchases of products, merchandise, goods, or services, without such individual&#39;s prior consent, or, in the case of a minor, the prior consent of such minor&#39;s parent or legal guardian, or in the case of a deceased individual, the consent of the executor or administrator, heirs, or devisees of such deceased individual, is liable to a civil action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A person is liable to a civil action if the person publishes, performs, distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public an individual&#39;s voice or likeness, with knowledge that use of the voice or likeness was not authorized by the individual or, in the case of a minor, the minor&#39;s parent or legal guardian, or in the case of a deceased individual, the executor or administrator, heirs, or devisees of such deceased individual.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A person is liable to a civil action if the person distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available an algorithm, software, tool, or other technology, service, or device, the primary purpose or function of such algorithm, software, tool, or other technology, service, or device is the production of a particular, identifiable individual&#39;s photograph, voice, or likeness, with knowledge that distributing, transmitting, or otherwise making available the photograph, voice, or likeness was not authorized by the individual or, in the case of a minor, the minor&#39;s parent or legal guardian, or in the case of a deceased individual, the executor or administrator, heirs, or devisees of such deceased individual.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. To the extent such use is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is deemed a fair use and not a violation of an individual&#39;s right, for purposes of this part, if the use of a name, photograph, voice, or likeness is:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. In connection with any news, public affairs, or sports broadcast or account;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. For purposes of comment, criticism, scholarship, satire, or parody;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. A representation of the individual as the individual&#39;s self in an audiovisual work, as defined under 17 U.S.C. Section 101, unless the audiovisual work containing the use is intended to create, and does create, the false impression that the work is an authentic recording in which the individual participated;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">4. Fleeting or incidental; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">5. In an advertisement or commercial announcement for a work described in this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The use of a name, photograph, voice, or likeness in a commercial medium does not constitute a use for purposes of advertising or solicitation solely because the material containing such use is commercially sponsored or contains paid advertising. Rather it shall be a question of fact whether or not the use of the complainant individual&#39;s name, photograph, voice, or likeness was so directly connected with the commercial sponsorship or with the paid advertising as to constitute a use for purposes of advertising or solicitation. Nothing in this subsection applies to the owners or employees of any medium used for advertising, including, but not limited to, newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, billboards, and transit ads, who have published or disseminated any advertisement or solicitation in violation of this part, unless it is established that such owners or employees had knowledge or reasonably should have known of the unauthorized use of the individual&#39;s name, photograph, voice, or likeness as prohibited by this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 3.
