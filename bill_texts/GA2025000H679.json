For many years, the cost of living in Georgia has been low, providing benefits to existing Georgians and encouraging future residents to move to Georgia. However, the cost of housing in Georgia has begun to rise steeply. One factor in this recent increase is coordination among landlords to fix rental prices. In 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice sued a Georgia landlord over price-fixing. This coordination not only undermines market competition, but it also threatens the financial well-being of Georgians. The General Assembly finds, therefore, that this Act is necessary to protect the general welfare of Georgians.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">\n    <b>SECTION 3.</b>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Chapter 8 of Title 13 of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, relating to illegal and void contracts generally, is amended by adding a new Code section to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot; <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">13-8-5.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) As used in this Code section, the term:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(1) &#39;Agreement&#39; means any contract, combination, or other agreement, whether verbal or written.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) &#39;Coordinator&#39; means an individual who uses or causes to be used a system, software, or process that performs a coordinating function for one or more landlords that compete in the same or a similar market, including a landlord that is performing a coordinating function for the landlord&#39;s own benefit.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(3) &#39;Landlord&#39; means the owner, lessor, or sublessor of a residential property or any person designated as an agent or representative of the owner, lessor, or sublessor, including, but not limited to, an agent, a resident manager, or a designated property manager.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(4) &#39;Person&#39; means any individual, partnership, association, firm, public or private corporation, trust, or unincorporated organization.
