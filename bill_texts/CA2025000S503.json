The bill would require, for each patient care decision support tool, developers and deployers to make reasonable efforts to mitigate the risk of discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic resulting from the tool&#39;s use in health programs or activities. The bill would require developers ensure that patient care decision support tools are tested for biased impacts in the outputs produced by the tool at least every 3 years.
