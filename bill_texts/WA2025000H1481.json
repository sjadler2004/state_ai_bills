The legislature finds that decarbonization\npolicies and artificial intelligence applications have accelerated demand on\nWashington's electricity grid.

The\nstudy must be referred to as the \"commercial liftoff for energy from advanced\nnuclear\" study. The study must include recommendations on how to maximize the\nbenefits of nuclear energy and small modular reactors in the state, including\nthe benefits of workforce development and job creation. The study must also\ninclude an examination of the feasibility and benefits of replacing a coal-\nfired electric generation facility as described in RCW _80.80.040_(3)(c) with\na nuclear power plant.\n\n(2) The joint legislative audit and review committee shall report to the\nappropriate committees of the legislature on the results of the study by July\n1, 2027.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 3.
