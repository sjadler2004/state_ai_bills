The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Owner&quot; means the person or entity to whom the vehicle is registered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Recorded image&quot; means images recorded by an automated speed enforcement system on:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) 2 or more photographs;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) 2 or more microphotographs;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) 2 or more electronic images; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Safety zone&quot; means an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school, or from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district that is used for educational purposes approved by the Illinois State Board of Education, not including school district headquarters or administrative buildings. A safety zone also includes an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district used for recreational purposes. However, if any portion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, the safety zone also shall include the roadway extended to the furthest portion of the next furthest intersection.

The term \"safety zone\" does not include any portion of\nthe roadway known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway with 8\nor more lanes of traffic.\n\n(a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be operational and\nviolations shall be recorded only at the following times:\n\n(i) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area,\nor land owned by a school district, only on school days and no earlier than 6\na.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of\nMonday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a Friday; and\n\n(ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area,\nor land owned by a park district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time\nthat the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other patrons, and\nno later than one hour after the facility, area, or land is closed to the\npublic or other patrons.\n\n(b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's\nviolation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the\nrecorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing\nthe alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations of this Code, the\nowner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic violation recorded by an automated\nspeed enforcement system shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per hour and no more than 10\nmiles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50,\nplus an additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay the\noriginal penalty in a timely manner; or\n\n(2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed\nlimit, a civil penalty not exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not\nmore than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner.\n\nA penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the driver of the motor\nvehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a\nspeeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the\nviolation that was recorded by the system. A violation for which a civil\npenalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic\nregulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the\ndriving record of the owner of the vehicle. A law enforcement officer is not\nrequired to be present or to witness the violation. No penalty may be imposed\nunder this Section if the recorded speed of a vehicle is 5 miles per hour or\nless over the legal speed limit. The municipality may send, in the same manner\nthat notices are sent under this Section, a speed violation warning notice\nwhere the violation involves a speed of 5 miles per hour or less above the\nlegal speed limit.\n\n(d) The net proceeds that a municipality receives from civil penalties imposed\nunder an automated speed enforcement system, after deducting all non-personnel\nand personnel costs associated with the operation and maintenance of such\nsystem, shall be expended or obligated by the municipality for the following\npurposes:\n\n(i) public safety initiatives to ensure safe passage around schools, and to\nprovide police protection and surveillance around schools and parks, including\nbut not limited to: (1) personnel costs; and (2) non-personnel costs such as\nconstruction and maintenance of public safety infrastructure and equipment;\n\n(ii) initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic safety;\n\n(iii) construction and maintenance of infrastructure within the municipality,\nincluding but not limited to roads and bridges; and\n\n(iv) after school programs.\n\n(e) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance\nrecorded by an automated speed enforcement system, the municipality having\njurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered\nowner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to\nthe registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the\nSecretary of State notifies the municipality of the identity of the owner of\nthe vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n(f) The notice required under subsection (e) of this Section shall include:\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n(3) the violation charged;\n\n(4) the date, time, and location where the violation occurred;\n\n(5) a copy of the recorded image or images;\n\n(6) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil\npenalty should be paid;\n\n(7) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a speed\nrestriction;\n\n(8) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in\na timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n(9) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n(A) paying the fine; or\n\n(B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing;\nand\n\n(10) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may\nview the recorded images of the violation.\n\n(g) (Blank).\n\n(h) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated speed\nenforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be\nevidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding\nalleging a violation under this Section.\n\n(i) Recorded images made by an automated speed enforcement system are\nconfidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and\ngovernmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a\nviolation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental\npurposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however,\nmay be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the\ncitation.\n\n(j) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration\nplates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not\nunder the control or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of\nthe violation;\n\n(1.5) that the motor vehicle was hijacked before the violation occurred and\nnot under the control of or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the\ntime of the violation;\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation\nfrom a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of\na mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; and\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal ordinance.\n\n(k) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle was hijacked or the motor vehicle or\nregistration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the\nviolation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner\nor lessee at the time of the violation, the owner or lessee must submit proof\nthat a report concerning the motor vehicle or registration plates was filed\nwith a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.\n\n(l) A roadway equipped with an automated speed enforcement system shall be\nposted with a sign conforming to the national Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices that is visible to approaching traffic stating that vehicle\nspeeds are being photo-enforced and indicating the speed limit.

No\nformer member of the General Assembly shall, within a period of 2 years\nimmediately after the termination of service as a member of the General\nAssembly, knowingly accept employment or receive compensation or fees for\nservices from a vendor that provides automated speed enforcement system\nequipment or services to municipalities or counties. No former officer or\nemployee of a municipality or county shall, within a period of 2 years\nimmediately after the termination of municipal or county employment, knowingly\naccept employment or receive compensation or fees for services from a vendor\nthat provides automated speed enforcement system equipment or services to\nmunicipalities or counties.\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease\nagreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement\nsystem violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease;\nprovided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within\n120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days\nafter such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license\nnumber of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the\nappropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection,\nthe municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the\nsame manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle\npursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n(q) A municipality using an automated speed enforcement system must provide\nnotice to drivers by publishing the locations of all safety zones where system\nequipment is installed on the website of the municipality.\n\n(r) A municipality operating an automated speed enforcement system shall\nconduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system\nfollowing installation of the system and every 2 years thereafter. A\nmunicipality operating an automated speed enforcement system before the\neffective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly shall\nconduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system by no\nlater than one year after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the\n103rd General Assembly and every 2 years thereafter. Each statistical analysis\nshall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and\nshall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system\nsufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. Each\nstatistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and\nacceptable industry practice. Each statistical analysis also shall be\nconsistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after\nconditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the\ninstallation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. Each statistical\nanalysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and\nshall be published on the website of the municipality.\n\n(s) This Section applies only to municipalities with a population of 1,000,000\nor more inhabitants.\n\n(t) If a county or municipality selects a new vendor for its automated speed\nenforcement system and must, as a consequence, apply for a permit, approval,\nor other authorization from the Department for reinstallation of one or more\nmalfunctioning components of that system and if, at the time of the\napplication for the permit, approval, or other authorization, the new vendor\noperates an automated speed enforcement system for any other county or\nmunicipality in the State, then the Department shall approve or deny the\ncounty or municipality's application for the permit, approval, or other\nauthorization within 90 days after its receipt.\n\n(u) The Department may revoke any permit, approval, or other authorization\ngranted to a county or municipality for the placement, installation, or\noperation of an automated speed enforcement system if any official or employee\nwho serves that county or municipality is charged with bribery, official\nmisconduct, or a similar crime related to the placement, installation, or\noperation of the automated speed enforcement system in the county or\nmunicipality.\n\nThe Department shall adopt any rules necessary to implement and administer\nthis subsection.

The Illinois Vehicle Code is amended by changing Section 11-208.8\nas follows:\n\n(625 ILCS 5/11-208.8)\n\nSec. 11-208.8. Automated speed enforcement systems in safety zones.\n\n(a) As used in this Section:\n\n\"Automated speed enforcement system\" means a photographic device, radar\ndevice, laser device, or other electrical or mechanical device or devices\ninstalled or utilized in a safety zone and designed to record the speed of a\nvehicle and obtain a clear photograph or other recorded image of the vehicle\nand the vehicle's registration plate or digital registration plate while the\ndriver is violating Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar\nprovision of a local ordinance.\n\nAn automated speed enforcement system is a system, located in a safety zone\nwhich is under the jurisdiction of a municipality, that produces a recorded\nimage of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a local\nordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and\nthe vehicle's license plate. The recorded image must also display the time,\ndate, and location of the violation.\n\n\"Owner\" means the person or entity to whom the vehicle is registered.\n\n\"Recorded image\" means images recorded by an automated speed enforcement\nsystem on:\n\n(1) 2 or more photographs;\n\n(2) 2 or more microphotographs;\n\n(3) 2 or more electronic images; or\n\n(4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or\nportion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or\ndigital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.\n\n\"Safety zone\" means an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the\nnearest property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school,\nor from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a\nschool district that is used for educational purposes approved by the Illinois\nState Board of Education, not including school district headquarters or\nadministrative buildings. A safety zone also includes an area that is within\none-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or\nland owned by a park district used for recreational purposes. However, if any\nportion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, the safety zone\nalso shall include the roadway extended to the furthest portion of the next\nfurthest intersection. The term \"safety zone\" does not include any portion of\nthe roadway known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway with 8\nor more lanes of traffic.\n\n(a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be operational and\nviolations shall be recorded only at the following times:\n\n(i) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area,\nor land owned by a school district, only on school days and no earlier than 6\na.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of\nMonday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a Friday; and\n\n(ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property line of any facility, area,\nor land owned by a park district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time\nthat the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other patrons, and\nno later than one hour after the facility, area, or land is closed to the\npublic or other patrons.\n\n(b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's\nviolation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the\nrecorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing\nthe alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet.\n\n(c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations of this Code, the\nowner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic violation recorded by an automated\nspeed enforcement system shall be subject to the following penalties:\n\n(1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per hour and no more than 10\nmiles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50,\nplus an additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay the\noriginal penalty in a timely manner; or\n\n(2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed\nlimit, a civil penalty not exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not\nmore than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner.\n\nA penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the driver of the motor\nvehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a\nspeeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the\nviolation that was recorded by the system. A violation for which a civil\npenalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic\nregulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the\ndriving record of the owner of the vehicle. A law enforcement officer is not\nrequired to be present or to witness the violation. No penalty may be imposed\nunder this Section if the recorded speed of a vehicle is 5 miles per hour or\nless over the legal speed limit. The municipality may send, in the same manner\nthat notices are sent under this Section, a speed violation warning notice\nwhere the violation involves a speed of 5 miles per hour or less above the\nlegal speed limit.\n\n(d) The net proceeds that a municipality receives from civil penalties imposed\nunder an automated speed enforcement system, after deducting all non-personnel\nand personnel costs associated with the operation and maintenance of such\nsystem, shall be expended or obligated by the municipality for the following\npurposes:\n\n(i) public safety initiatives to ensure safe passage around schools, and to\nprovide police protection and surveillance around schools and parks, including\nbut not limited to: (1) personnel costs; and (2) non-personnel costs such as\nconstruction and maintenance of public safety infrastructure and equipment;\n\n(ii) initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic safety;\n\n(iii) construction and maintenance of infrastructure within the municipality,\nincluding but not limited to roads and bridges; and\n\n(iv) after school programs.\n\n(e) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance\nrecorded by an automated speed enforcement system, the municipality having\njurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered\nowner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to\nthe registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the\nSecretary of State notifies the municipality of the identity of the owner of\nthe vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.\n\n(f) The notice required under subsection (e) of this Section shall include:\n\n(1) the name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle;\n\n(2) the registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation;\n\n(3) the violation charged;\n\n(4) the date, time, and location where the violation occurred;\n\n(5) a copy of the recorded image or images;\n\n(6) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the date by which the civil\npenalty should be paid;\n\n(7) a statement that recorded images are evidence of a violation of a speed\nrestriction;\n\n(8) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty or to contest liability in\na timely manner is an admission of liability;\n\n(9) a statement that the person may elect to proceed by:\n\n(A) paying the fine; or\n\n(B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or by administrative hearing;\nand\n\n(10) a website address, accessible through the Internet, where the person may\nview the recorded images of the violation.\n\n(g) (Blank).\n\n(h) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated speed\nenforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be\nevidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding\nalleging a violation under this Section.\n\n(i) Recorded images made by an automated speed enforcement system are\nconfidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and\ngovernmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a\nviolation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental\npurposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however,\nmay be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the\ncitation.\n\n(j) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:\n\n(1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or digital registration\nplates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not\nunder the control or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the time of\nthe violation;\n\n(1.5) that the motor vehicle was hijacked before the violation occurred and\nnot under the control of or in the possession of the owner or lessee at the\ntime of the violation;\n\n(2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation\nfrom a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of\na mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; and\n\n(3) any other evidence or issues provided by municipal ordinance.\n\n(k) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle was hijacked or the motor vehicle or\nregistration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the\nviolation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner\nor lessee at the time of the violation, the owner or lessee must submit proof\nthat a report concerning the motor vehicle or registration plates was filed\nwith a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.\n\n(l) A roadway equipped with an automated speed enforcement system shall be\nposted with a sign conforming to the national Manual on Uniform Traffic\nControl Devices that is visible to approaching traffic stating that vehicle\nspeeds are being photo-enforced and indicating the speed limit. The\nmunicipality shall install such additional signage as it determines is\nnecessary to give reasonable notice to drivers as to where automated speed\nenforcement systems are installed.\n\n(m) A roadway where a new automated speed enforcement system is installed\nshall be posted with signs providing 30 days notice of the use of a new\nautomated speed enforcement system prior to the issuance of any citations\nthrough the automated speed enforcement system.\n\n(n) The compensation paid for an automated speed enforcement system must be\nbased on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be\nbased on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by\nthe system.\n\n(n-1) No member of the General Assembly and no officer or employee of a\nmunicipality or county shall knowingly accept employment or receive\ncompensation or fees for services from a vendor that provides automated speed\nenforcement system equipment or services to municipalities or counties. No\nformer member of the General Assembly shall, within a period of 2 years\nimmediately after the termination of service as a member of the General\nAssembly, knowingly accept employment or receive compensation or fees for\nservices from a vendor that provides automated speed enforcement system\nequipment or services to municipalities or counties. No former officer or\nemployee of a municipality or county shall, within a period of 2 years\nimmediately after the termination of municipal or county employment, knowingly\naccept employment or receive compensation or fees for services from a vendor\nthat provides automated speed enforcement system equipment or services to\nmunicipalities or counties.\n\n(o) (Blank).\n\n(p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease\nagreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement\nsystem violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease;\nprovided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within\n120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days\nafter such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license\nnumber of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the\nappropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.\n\nUpon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection,\nthe municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the\nsame manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle\npursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.\n\n(q) A municipality using an automated speed enforcement system must provide\nnotice to drivers by publishing the locations of all safety zones where system\nequipment is installed on the website of the municipality.\n\n(r) A municipality operating an automated speed enforcement system shall\nconduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system\nfollowing installation of the system and every 2 years thereafter. A\nmunicipality operating an automated speed enforcement system before the\neffective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly shall\nconduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system by no\nlater than one year after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the\n103rd General Assembly and every 2 years thereafter. Each statistical analysis\nshall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and\nshall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system\nsufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. Each\nstatistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and\nacceptable industry practice. Each statistical analysis also shall be\nconsistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after\nconditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the\ninstallation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. Each statistical\nanalysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and\nshall be published on the website of the municipality.\n\n(s) This Section applies only to municipalities with a population of 1,000,000\nor more inhabitants.\n\n(t) If a county or municipality selects a new vendor for its automated speed\nenforcement system and must, as a consequence, apply for a permit, approval,\nor other authorization from the Department for reinstallation of one or more\nmalfunctioning components of that system and if, at the time of the\napplication for the permit, approval, or other authorization, the new vendor\noperates an automated speed enforcement system for any other county or\nmunicipality in the State, then the Department shall approve or deny the\ncounty or municipality's application for the permit, approval, or other\nauthorization within 90 days after its receipt.\n\n(u) The Department may revoke any permit, approval, or other authorization\ngranted to a county or municipality for the placement, installation, or\noperation of an automated speed enforcement system if any official or employee\nwho serves that county or municipality is charged with bribery, official\nmisconduct, or a similar crime related to the placement, installation, or\noperation of the automated speed enforcement system in the county or\nmunicipality.\n\nThe Department shall adopt any rules necessary to implement and administer\nthis subsection. The rules adopted by the Department shall describe the\nrevocation process, shall ensure that notice of the revocation is provided,\nand shall provide an opportunity to appeal the revocation. Any county or\nmunicipality that has a permit, approval, or other authorization revoked under\nthis subsection may not reapply for such a permit, approval, or other\nauthorization for a period of 1 year after the revocation.\n\n_(v) The University of Illinois Chicago Urban Transportation Center shall\nconduct a study that includes the following:_\n\n_(1) a comprehensive review of the City of Chicago 's website multi-year crash\ndata on North and South DuSable Lake Shore Drive;_\n\n_(2) the available research on potential effectiveness of cameras powered by\nartificial intelligence in improving compliance and reducing crashes and road\nfatalities on North and South DuSable Lake Shore Drive;_\n\n_(3) an analysis of driving behavior to detect risky driving patterns and to\naddress the DuSable Lake Shore Drive crash corridors;_\n\n_(4) an assessment of the effectiveness of psychological deterrence in\nreducing habitual speeding; and_\n\n_(5) an assessment of how fatalities can be reduced using these cameras\npowered by artificial intelligence and other technical options that may be\navailable in place of cameras powered by artificial intelligence._\n\n_The Department shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this subsection\n(v)._\n\n(Source: P.A. 102-905, eff. 1-1-23; 103-364, eff. 7-28-23.)\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
