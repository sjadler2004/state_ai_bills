The law enforcement agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within fifteen days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. The notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by certified mail with return receipt requested. Service by mail shall be deemed complete upon mailing within the fifteen day period following the seizure.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) If no person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person&#39;s claim of ownership or right to possession of seized items within forty-five days of the seizure, the item seized shall be deemed forfeited.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) If any person notifies the seizing law enforcement agency in writing of the person&#39;s claim of ownership or right to possession of seized items within forty-five days of the seizure, the person or persons shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to the claim or right. The hearing shall be before an administrative law judge appointed under chapter <u>34.12</u> RCW, except that any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction if the aggregate value of the article or articles involved is more than five hundred dollars. The hearing before an administrative law judge and any appeal therefrom shall be under Title <u>34</u> RCW. In a court hearing between two or more claimants to the article or articles involved, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorney&#39;s fees. The burden of producing evidence shall be upon the person claiming to be the lawful owner or the person claiming to have the lawful right to possession of the seized items. The seizing law enforcement agency shall promptly return the article or articles to the claimant upon a determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is lawfully entitled to possession thereof of the seized items.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) If property is sought to be forfeited on the ground that it constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of this chapter, the seizing law enforcement agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) When property is forfeited under this chapter the seizing law enforcement agency may:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release the property to that agency for the exclusive use of enforcing this chapter or chapter <u>9A.88</u> RCW;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Request the appropriate sheriff or director of public safety to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10)(a) By January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state an amount equal to ten percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year. Money remitted shall be deposited in the prostitution prevention and intervention account under RCW <u>43.63A.740</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to an independent selling agency.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the state under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of the investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the subject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city attorney, and court costs. Money remaining after payment of these expenses shall be retained by the seizing law enforcement agency for the exclusive use of enforcing the provisions of this chapter or chapter <u>9A.88</u> RCW.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5.

Money remitted shall be\ndeposited in the prostitution prevention and intervention account under RCW\n_43.63A.740_.\n\n(b) The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable\ninterest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide\nsecurity interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and\nin the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including\nreasonable fees or commissions paid to an independent selling agency.\n\n(c) The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of\nretained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the\ntime of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable\ncommonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an\nindependent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property.\nIf an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the\ncost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms\nor illegal property is zero.\n\n(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the\nstate under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of\nthe investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the\nsubject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the\nproceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure,\nmaintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city\nattorney, and court costs.

The law enforcement agency under whose authority the seizure was made shall cause notice to be served within fifteen days following the seizure on the owner of the property seized and the person in charge thereof and any person having any known right or interest therein, of the seizure and intended forfeiture of the seized property. The notice may be served by any method authorized by law or court rule including but not limited to service by certified mail with return receipt requested.

The hearing shall be before an administrative law judge appointed under chapter <u>34.12</u> RCW, except that any person asserting a claim or right may remove the matter to a court of competent jurisdiction if the aggregate value of the article or articles involved is more than five hundred dollars. The hearing before an administrative law judge and any appeal therefrom shall be under Title <u>34</u> RCW. In a court hearing between two or more claimants to the article or articles involved, the prevailing party shall be entitled to a judgment for costs and reasonable attorney&#39;s fees.

The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the state under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of the investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the subject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city attorney, and court costs.

The value of\nretained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the\ntime of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable\ncommonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an\nindependent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property.\nIf an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the\ncost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms\nor illegal property is zero.\n\n(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the\nstate under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of\nthe investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the\nsubject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the\nproceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure,\nmaintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city\nattorney, and court costs.

The seizing law enforcement agency shall promptly return the article or articles to the claimant upon a determination by the administrative law judge or court that the claimant is lawfully entitled to possession thereof of the seized items.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) If property is sought to be forfeited on the ground that it constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of this chapter, the seizing law enforcement agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the property constitutes proceeds traceable to a violation of this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) When property is forfeited under this chapter the seizing law enforcement agency may:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Retain it for official use or upon application by any law enforcement agency of this state release the property to that agency for the exclusive use of enforcing this chapter or chapter <u>9A.88</u> RCW;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Sell that which is not required to be destroyed by law and which is not harmful to the public; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Request the appropriate sheriff or director of public safety to take custody of the property and remove it for disposition in accordance with law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10)(a) By January 31st of each year, each seizing agency shall remit to the state an amount equal to ten percent of the net proceeds of any property forfeited during the preceding calendar year. Money remitted shall be deposited in the prostitution prevention and intervention account under RCW <u>43.63A.740</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The net proceeds of forfeited property is the value of the forfeitable interest in the property after deducting the cost of satisfying any bona fide security interest to which the property is subject at the time of seizure; and in the case of sold property, after deducting the cost of sale, including reasonable fees or commissions paid to an independent selling agency.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The value of sold forfeited property is the sale price. The value of retained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the time of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable commonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an independent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property. If an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the cost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms or illegal property is zero.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the state under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of the investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the subject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city attorney, and court costs. Money remaining after payment of these expenses shall be retained by the seizing law enforcement agency for the exclusive use of enforcing the provisions of this chapter or chapter <u>9A.88</u> RCW.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5.

The value of\nretained forfeited property is the fair market value of the property at the\ntime of seizure determined when possible by reference to an applicable\ncommonly used index. A seizing agency may use, but need not use, an\nindependent qualified appraiser to determine the value of retained property.\nIf an appraiser is used, the value of the property appraised is net of the\ncost of the appraisal. The value of destroyed property and retained firearms\nor illegal property is zero.\n\n(11) Forfeited property and net proceeds not required to be remitted to the\nstate under this chapter shall be used for payment of all proper expenses of\nthe investigation leading to the seizure, including any money delivered to the\nsubject of the investigation by the law enforcement agency, and of the\nproceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure,\nmaintenance of custody, advertising, actual costs of the prosecuting or city\nattorney, and court costs.
