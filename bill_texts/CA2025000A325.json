Cartwright Act: violations.\n\nExisting law establishes the Attorney General as the head of the Department of\nJustice, with charge of all legal matters in which the state is interested,\nexcept as specified. Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney\nGeneral related to consumer protection, including, among others, the\nsupervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws.\nExisting law, commonly known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts\nthat are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts and prescribes\nprovisions for its enforcement.\n\nExisting law requires a complaint or cross-complaint to contain, among other\nthings, a statement of facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and\nconcise language.\n\nThis bill would instead provide that in a complaint for any violation of the\nCartwright Act, it is sufficient to contain factual allegations demonstrating\nthat the existence of a contract, combination in the form of a trust, or\nconspiracy to restrain trade or commerce is plausible. The bill would provide\nthat a complaint for any violation of the Cartwright Act is not required to\nallege facts tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.\n\nThis bill would also prohibit a person from using or distributing any pricing\nalgorithm that uses, incorporates, or was trained with nonpublic competitor\ndata, as defined. The bill would~~provide that certain presumptions are\nestablished as applicable, including that the defendant entered into a\ncontract in restraint of trade, as specified, if any of specified requirements\nare established, including that the defendant distributed the pricing\nalgorithm to 2 or more persons with the intent that the pricing algorithm be\nused to set or recommend a price, as defined, or commercial term, as defined,\nof a product or service in the same market or a related market and 2 or more\npersons used the pricing~~ _make it unlawful, except as provided, for a person\nto use or distribute any pricing algorithm that uses, incorporates, or was\ntrained with data other than nonpublic competitor data if the person either\ndistributes the pricing algorithm, as specified, or uses the pricing_\nalgorithm to set or recommend a price or commercial term of a product\nor~~service.~~ _service and the pricing algorithm was used by another person\nto set or recommend a price or commercial term of a product or service in the\nsame market or a related market._ Because the bill would expand the scope of\nactivities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is\npunishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

The bill would provide\nthat a complaint for any violation of the Cartwright Act is not required to\nallege facts tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.\n\nThis bill would also prohibit a person from using or distributing any pricing\nalgorithm that uses, incorporates, or was trained with nonpublic competitor\ndata, as defined. The bill would make it unlawful, except as provided, for a\nperson to use or distribute any pricing algorithm that uses, incorporates, or\nwas trained with data other than nonpublic competitor data if the person\neither distributes the pricing algorithm, as specified, or uses the pricing\nalgorithm to set or recommend a price or commercial term of a product or\nservice and the pricing algorithm was used by another person to set or\nrecommend a price or commercial term of a product or service in the same\nmarket or a related market. Because the bill would expand the scope of\nactivities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is\npunishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

Cartwright Act: violations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law establishes the Attorney General as the head of the Department of Justice, with charge of all legal matters in which the state is interested, except as specified. Existing law imposes various requirements on the Attorney General related to consumer protection, including, among others, the supervision of charitable trusts and the enforcement of antitrust laws. Existing law, commonly known as the Cartwright Act, identifies certain acts that are unlawful restraints of trade and unlawful trusts and prescribes provisions for its enforcement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires a complaint or cross-complaint to contain, among other things, a statement of facts constituting the cause of action, in ordinary and concise language.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would instead provide that in a complaint for any violation of the Cartwright Act, it is sufficient to contain factual allegations demonstrating that the existence of a contract, combination in the form of a trust, or conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce is plausible. The bill would provide that a complaint for any violation of the Cartwright Act is not required to allege facts tending to exclude the possibility of independent action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would also make it unlawful for a person to use or distribute a common pricing algorithm as part of a contract, combination in the form of a trust, or conspiracy to restrain trade or commerce. The bill would make it unlawful for a person to use or distribute a common pricing algorithm if the person<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> either distributes the common pricing algorithm, as specified, or uses the common pricing algorithm to set or recommend prices or commercial terms of products or services and either knows or should know that they are adhering to or participating in a scheme to fix the price or commercial term of the same or a similar product or service, as specified, or coerces any</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> coerces another</u> person to set or adopt a recommended price or commercial term for the same or similar products or<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> services, as specified.</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> services in the jurisdiction of the state.</u> Because the bill would expand the scope of activities prohibited by the Cartwright Act, the violation of which is punishable as a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.
