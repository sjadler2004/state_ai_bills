The department shall not disclose any financial, production, or sales data reported by a producer pursuant to this section, except that the department may disclose such data in aggregate or summary format, provided that the producers and their financial, production, or sales data are not specifically identified, and provided that the summary omits any reference to unique characteristics from which the identities of individual producers might be inferred or otherwise ascertained. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> 11. (New section) a. Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated any provision of this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or has knowingly made a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this act, the commissioner may: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (1) issue an order, in accordance with subsection b. of this section, requiring the violator to comply with the provisions of this act, the rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, or the stewardship plan approved thereunder, as the case may be;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (2) bring a civil action in accordance with subsection c. of this section; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (3) levy a civil administrative penalty in accordance with subsection d. of this section;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (4) bring an action for a civil penalty in accordance with subsection e. of this section; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (5) notify the public of a producer that is not in compliance with the requirements of this act. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Pursuit of any of the remedies specified under this section shall not preclude the seeking of any other remedy specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> b. Whenever the commissioner finds that a person has violated this act, any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or any provision of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, the commissioner may issue an administrative enforcement order to the person: specifying the provision or provisions that the person has violated; citing the action that constituted the violation; requiring the person&#39;s compliance with the provision violated; and giving notice of the person&#39;s right to a hearing on the matters contained in the administrative enforcement order. The person subject to the order shall have 20 calendar days from receipt of the order within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing. After the hearing, and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order. If no hearing is requested, the order shall become final after the expiration of the 20-day period. A request for hearing shall not automatically stay the effect of the order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> c. The commissioner shall be authorized to institute a civil action in Superior Court for appropriate relief from any violation of the provisions of this act, or of any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or of a stewardship plan approved thereunder. Such relief may include, singly or in combination: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (1) a temporary or permanent injunction; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (2) recovery of the reasonable costs of any investigation or inspection that led to the discovery of the violation, and for the recovery of the reasonable costs of preparing and bringing a civil action commenced under this subsection;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (3) recovery of reasonable costs incurred by the State in removing, correcting, or terminating the adverse effects resulting from the violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (4) recovery of compensatory damages caused by a violation for which a civil action has been commenced and brought under this subsection.

(1) The commissioner shall be authorized to assess a civil administrative penalty of not less than $5,000 nor more than $10,000 for each violation, provided that each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. In assessing a civil administrative penalty, the commissioner shall consider the severity of the violation, the measures taken to prevent further violations, and whether the penalty will act as an appropriate deterrent. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (2) Prior to the assessment of a civil administrative penalty under this subsection, the person committing the violation shall be notified by certified mail or personal service that the penalty is being assessed. The notice shall identify the section of the statute, rule, regulation, or order, or the provision of the stewardship plan, that was violated; recite the facts alleged to constitute a violation; state the basis for the amount of the civil administrative penalties to be assessed; and affirm the rights of the alleged violator to a hearing. The ordered party shall have 35 days from receipt of the notice within which to deliver to the commissioner a written request for a hearing. After the hearing and upon finding that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may issue a final order after assessing the amount of the fine specified in the notice. If no hearing is requested, the notice shall become a final order after the expiration of the 35-day period. Payment of the assessment is due when a final order is issued or the notice becomes a final order. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (3) The authority to levy an administrative order is in addition to all other enforcement provisions in this act, and the payment of any assessment shall not be deemed to affect the availability of any other enforcement provisions in connection with the violation for which the assessment is levied. The department may compromise any civil administrative penalty assessed under this section in an amount and with conditions the department determines appropriate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> e. A person who violates any provision of this act, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto, or the provisions of a stewardship plan approved thereunder, or an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection b. of this section, or a court order issued pursuant to subsection c. of this section, or who fails to pay a civil administrative penalty in full pursuant to subsection d. of this section, or who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement on any application, record, report, or other document required to be submitted to the department, shall be subject, upon order of a court, to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of the violation, and each day during which the violation continues shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. Any civil penalty imposed pursuant to this subsection may be collected with costs in a summary proceeding pursuant to the &quot;Penalty Enforcement Law of 1999,&quot; P.L.1999, c.274 (C.2A:58-10 et seq.), or may be collected in a civil action commenced by the commissioner. In addition to any penalties, costs, or interest charges, the Superior Court, or the municipal court as the case may be, may assess against the violator the amount of economic benefit accruing to the violator from the violation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> f. All penalties collected by the department pursuant to this act shall be deposited into the to the &quot;Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; established pursuant to section 8 of this act, and appropriated annually for the continued administration and enforcement of this act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> 12. (New section) a. Except as provided in subsection b. of this section, an action undertaken by a producer or group of producers, which affects the types or quantities of packaging products being recycled or the cost or structure of any collection or recycling program, shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of any State law relating to antitrust, restraint of trade, unfair trade practices, or the regulation of trade or commerce, so long as the action is necessary to plan for or implement the organized collection or recycling of packaging products pursuant to this act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> b. The provisions of subsection a. of this section shall not apply to: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (1) any agreement establishing or affecting the price of a product; or </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> (2) any agreement restricting the output or production of a product or the geographic area or customers to which a product will be sold.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> 13.

The Commissioner of Environmental Protection shall adopt rules and regulations, pursuant to the &quot;Administrative Procedure Act,&quot; P.L.1968, c.410 (C.52:14B-1 et seq.), as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act.</p>\n   <effective_clause>\n    <p class=\"indent\"> 18. This act shall take effect immediately.</p>\n   </effective_clause>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"digest_document_section\"></a><div class=\"digest\">\n   <p class=\"center\">STATEMENT</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> This committee substitute would require certain manufacturers and distributors of products that utilize packaging to adopt and implement plans to decrease the amount of packaging that is disposed of as solid waste, and to pay an annual surcharge to the State, the proceeds of which would be used to improve the State&#39;s recycling system. The bill would also establish a new Office of Plastics and Packaging Management in the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to oversee the administration and enforcement of laws dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would require the DEP, within one year after the bill&#39;s enactment, to conduct a needs assessment of the State&#39;s solid waste and recycling system. The needs assessment would be required to include, among other things, an estimate of the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure upgrades that are necessary for the State to meet the recycling rate targets for packaging products established in section 5 of the bill. The bill would require the DEP to update the needs assessment every five years.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would authorize producers covered under the bill to collaborate in meeting the bill&#39;s requirements by forming producer responsibility organizations (PROs). The DEP would be authorized to approve up to 10 PROs. A PRO would be authorized to submit a single packaging product stewardship plan that covers all producers that are members of the PRO, and to take other actions to facilitate producers&#39; compliance with the bill&#39;s provisions. The bill would also authorize producers to comply with the bill&#39;s provisions individually, if they so choose. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Section 5 of the bill would establish certain requirements concerning the sale and composition of packaging products. First, it would require that, by 2032, the cumulative amount of single-use packaging products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State be reduced by 25 percent in volume. At least 10 percent of this reduction would be required to be achieved by shifting to reusable products or by eliminating plastic components. Second, it would require that, by 2034, all packaging products be either compostable or recyclable. Third, it would require that, by 2036, the recycling rate of packaging products in the State be at least 65 percent. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would require each PRO, no later than 5 years after the bill&#39;s enactment, to develop and implement a packaging product stewardship plan (plan). Each PRO would be required to first submit a draft of its plan to the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management, established pursuant to the &quot;Solid Waste Management Act,&quot; P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), for review and comment. The PRO would then be required to submit its plan to the DEP for approval. The bill would establish various requirements for the content of a plan, including that it identify the strategies that will be used by participating producers to reduce, through product design modifications and program innovation, the amount of material that is used for each packaging product and the amount of waste resulting from the use of each packaging product. The plan would also be required to include a detailed budget, which would be required to be evaluated by an independent financial auditor to ensure that it is sufficient to costs of implementing the plan. The PRO would raise money to fund the implementation of the plan by imposing fees on its members. The fees would be proportional to the amount of packaging produced by the member, as well as the environmental impact of the packaging.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would also establish the &quot;Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; in the Department of the Treasury. Moneys in the fund would be used to (1) fund efforts to improve the State&#39;s recycling system, as identified in the Statewide needs assessment, in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the DEP, or (2) to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill. Each PRO (and any producers not participating in a PRO) would be assessed an annual surcharge by the Division of Taxation in the Treasury, and the moneys from the surcharge would be placed in the &quot;Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund.&quot; The total Statewide surcharge would be the amount needed during the following fiscal year to administer and enforce the bill&#39;s provisions and improve the State&#39;s recycling system in order to meet the recycling rate and other targets established by section 5 of the bill, as determined by the Statewide needs assessment, up to a maximum of $120 million. The amount owed by each PRO or non-participating producer would be a prorated share of this total amount.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> PROs and non-participating producers would be required by the bill to engage in public outreach, to address public questions and concerns, and to provide consumers with educational and informational materials related to the stewardship plan and the services that are available thereunder. PROs and non-participating producers would also be authorized to provide educational and informational materials to retailers regarding the implementation of the stewardship plan.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would establish an Office of Plastics and Packaging Management (office) in the DEP. The purpose of the office would be to oversee the administration and enforcement of this bill, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126 et al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135 et seq.), and any other law dealing with pollution from plastic and other packaging. The office would include an Inspector General, who would, among other things, act as a liaison between the DEP, the Department of Law and Public Safety, county prosecutor&#39;s offices, and other local governments, regarding the enforcement of laws under the purview of the office.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill would amend existing law to add several duties regarding the implementation of the bill&#39;s provisions to the duties of the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management (council), including a duty to review packaging product stewardship plans submitted by PROs and non-participating producers. The bill would also require certain existing recommendations from the council to be provided to the DEP commissioner at least every five years, rather than &quot;from time to time,&quot; as stated in current law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Finally, the bill would establish various civil and administrative penalties for persons who violate the provisions of the bill, any rules or regulations adopted pursuant thereto, any stewardship plan approved thereunder, or any order issued by the DEP commissioner in enforcing the bill. </p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

This act shall take effect immediately.\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nThis committee substitute would require certain manufacturers and distributors\nof products that utilize packaging to adopt and implement plans to decrease\nthe amount of packaging that is disposed of as solid waste, and to pay an\nannual surcharge to the State, the proceeds of which would be used to improve\nthe State's recycling system. The bill would also establish a new Office of\nPlastics and Packaging Management in the Department of Environmental\nProtection (DEP) to oversee the administration and enforcement of laws dealing\nwith pollution from plastic and other packaging.\n\nThe bill would require the DEP, within one year after the bill's enactment, to\nconduct a needs assessment of the State's solid waste and recycling system.\nThe needs assessment would be required to include, among other things, an\nestimate of the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure upgrades\nthat are necessary for the State to meet the recycling rate targets for\npackaging products established in section 5 of the bill. The bill would\nrequire the DEP to update the needs assessment every five years.\n\nThe bill would authorize producers covered under the bill to collaborate in\nmeeting the bill's requirements by forming producer responsibility\norganizations (PROs). The DEP would be authorized to approve up to 10 PROs. A\nPRO would be authorized to submit a single packaging product stewardship plan\nthat covers all producers that are members of the PRO, and to take other\nactions to facilitate producers' compliance with the bill's provisions. The\nbill would also authorize producers to comply with the bill's provisions\nindividually, if they so choose.\n\nSection 5 of the bill would establish certain requirements concerning the sale\nand composition of packaging products. First, it would require that, by 2032,\nthe cumulative amount of single-use packaging products sold, offered for sale,\nimported, or distributed in or into the State be reduced by 25 percent in\nvolume. At least 10 percent of this reduction would be required to be achieved\nby shifting to reusable products or by eliminating plastic components. Second,\nit would require that, by 2034, all packaging products be either compostable\nor recyclable. Third, it would require that, by 2036, the recycling rate of\npackaging products in the State be at least 65 percent.\n\nThe bill would require each PRO, no later than 5 years after the bill's\nenactment, to develop and implement a packaging product stewardship plan\n(plan). Each PRO would be required to first submit a draft of its plan to the\nAdvisory Council on Solid Waste Management, established pursuant to the \"Solid\nWaste Management Act,\" P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), for review and\ncomment. The PRO would then be required to submit its plan to the DEP for\napproval. The bill would establish various requirements for the content of a\nplan, including that it identify the strategies that will be used by\nparticipating producers to reduce, through product design modifications and\nprogram innovation, the amount of material that is used for each packaging\nproduct and the amount of waste resulting from the use of each packaging\nproduct. The plan would also be required to include a detailed budget, which\nwould be required to be evaluated by an independent financial auditor to\nensure that it is sufficient to costs of implementing the plan. The PRO would\nraise money to fund the implementation of the plan by imposing fees on its\nmembers. The fees would be proportional to the amount of packaging produced by\nthe member, as well as the environmental impact of the packaging.\n\nThe bill would also establish the \"Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund\" in\nthe Department of the Treasury. Moneys in the fund would be used to (1) fund\nefforts to improve the State's recycling system, as identified in the\nStatewide needs assessment, in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued\nby the DEP, or (2) to administer and enforce the provisions of the bill. Each\nPRO (and any producers not participating in a PRO) would be assessed an annual\nsurcharge by the Division of Taxation in the Treasury, and the moneys from the\nsurcharge would be placed in the \"Packaging Reduction and Recycling Fund.\" The\ntotal Statewide surcharge would be the amount needed during the following\nfiscal year to administer and enforce the bill's provisions and improve the\nState's recycling system in order to meet the recycling rate and other targets\nestablished by section 5 of the bill, as determined by the Statewide needs\nassessment, up to a maximum of $120 million. The amount owed by each PRO or\nnon-participating producer would be a prorated share of this total amount.\n\nPROs and non-participating producers would be required by the bill to engage\nin public outreach, to address public questions and concerns, and to provide\nconsumers with educational and informational materials related to the\nstewardship plan and the services that are available thereunder. PROs and non-\nparticipating producers would also be authorized to provide educational and\ninformational materials to retailers regarding the implementation of the\nstewardship plan.\n\nThe bill would establish an Office of Plastics and Packaging Management\n(office) in the DEP. The purpose of the office would be to oversee the\nadministration and enforcement of this bill, P.L.2020, c.117 (C.13:1E-99.126\net al.), P.L.2021, c.391 (C.13:1E-99.135 et seq.), and any other law dealing\nwith pollution from plastic and other packaging. The office would include an\nInspector General, who would, among other things, act as a liaison between the\nDEP, the Department of Law and Public Safety, county prosecutor's offices, and\nother local governments, regarding the enforcement of laws under the purview\nof the office.\n\nThe bill would amend existing law to add several duties regarding the\nimplementation of the bill's provisions to the duties of the Advisory Council\non Solid Waste Management (council), including a duty to review packaging\nproduct stewardship plans submitted by PROs and non-participating producers.\nThe bill would also require certain existing recommendations from the council\nto be provided to the DEP commissioner at least every five years, rather than\n\"from time to time,\" as stated in current law.\n\nFinally, the bill would establish various civil and administrative penalties\nfor persons who violate the provisions of the bill, any rules or regulations\nadopted pursuant thereto, any stewardship plan approved thereunder, or any\norder issued by the DEP commissioner in enforcing the bill.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

(C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and biennially thereafter, the department, in consultation with the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-7), shall review relevant data to assess whether the recycling and source reduction requirements established pursuant to this section should be adjusted. The department shall make its determination and rationale available for public review by publishing a report on its Internet website. If the department determines that current unforeseen and anomalous market conditions, including, but not limited to, recycling infrastructure conditions, warrant an adjustment, the department may adopt rules and regulations to adjust the interim requirements established pursuant to subsection b. of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">d. A producer may be credited with source reduction efforts carried out during a five-year period prior to the baseline year established pursuant to subsection a. of this section, provided that the efforts are documented in an approved product stewardship plan in conformance with the provisions of subsection g. of section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">e. During the first five years after the approval of the applicable producer&#39;s product stewardship plan pursuant to section 8 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), single-use plastic packaging used solely to contain or wrap uncooked meat, fish, or poultry shall be exempt from the provisions of this section. After the initial five-year exemption period, the producer may apply to the department for an additional five-year exemption period pursuant to this subsection. The department shall grant an additional exemption if the producer demonstrates to the department&#39;s satisfaction that recycling infrastructure is not available to sufficiently handle the single-use plastic packaging.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">7. (New section) a. No later than 18 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the producer responsibility organization and each non-participating producer shall develop, in consultation with appropriate stakeholders, including, but not limited to, producers, local governments, service providers, appropriate nonprofit organizations, and residents, a product stewardship plan. A PRO or producer, as applicable, shall submit a draft of its product stewardship plan to the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-7) for review and comment, prior to submitting the plan to the department. The council shall provide the PRO or producer, as applicable, with written comments on the draft stewardship plan within 60 days after receipt thereof. The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall consider the comments and may incorporate these comments into the stewardship plan. The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall submit the finalized product stewardship plan to the department within 120 days after receipt of the council&#39;s comments, and the department shall review the plan for compliance with the provisions of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">b. A product stewardship plan developed pursuant to this section shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) identify, and provide contact information for, each producer participating in the plan;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) include a comprehensive list of the covered products that are covered by the plan, including, as applicable, the brand names of any such products;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) identify the means, methods, processes, procedures, systems, and strategies that will be used by participating producers to: (a) reduce, through product design modifications and program innovation, the amount of material that is used for each covered product and the amount of waste resulting from the use of each covered product; (b) facilitate and promote the prompt and efficient collection of discarded covered products throughout the State in a manner that is as, or more, convenient for consumers than the other collection programs available prior to the implementation of the product stewardship plan; (c) transport discarded covered products to authorized storage and recycling facilities; and (d) facilitate the reuse of discarded covered products for alternate second-life purposes, and the processing and recycling of discarded covered products that cannot be reused for alternate second-life purposes;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) identify the methods that will be used by participating producers to meet the source reduction and recycling goals established pursuant to section 6 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) describe the ways in which existing municipal solid waste collection and recycling infrastructure will be used to implement the stewardship plan, or, if existing infrastructure will not be used, provide an explanation as to why it is necessary to establish separate infrastructure, as well as a description of how the separate infrastructure system will function, and an indication of the date by which the separate infrastructure system is expected to commence operations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) describe the ways in which the participating producers will work with existing service providers throughout the State to effectuate the collection, transportation, reuse, and recycling of covered products, in accordance with environmentally sound management practices, describe the system that will be used to reimburse those service providers for the services provided pursuant to subsection e. of this section, and identify the name and address of all authorized service providers that will be directly utilized pursuant to the plan; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) certify that participating producers will use open, competitive, and fair procurement practices, in compliance with the &quot;Local Public Contracts Law,&quot; P.L.1971, c.198 (C.40A:11-1 et seq.), when directly entering into contractual agreements with local governments and other service providers pursuant to the stewardship plan;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) describe the process that was used, during the development of the stewardship plan, to receive, consider, and implement the comments of various stakeholders, as well as the nature of stakeholder comments received during the plan development period, and the extent to which the stakeholders&#39; comments were incorporated into the stewardship plan;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) describe the means and methods that will be used by the PRO or producer, as applicable, to facilitate public outreach, education, and communication with respect to the stewardship plan, in accordance with the provisions of section 11 of P.L., c.

The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall update the list and submit any updates for inclusion on the list in its annual report, based on improvements in recycling and processing and in end markets. The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall consult the Advisory Council on Solid Waste Management established pursuant to section 7 of P.L.1970, c.39 (C.13:1E-7) on any updates to the list. Any updates to the list shall be approved by the department; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(16) describe how the PRO or producer, as applicable, will provide a PRO or a producer with the option to purchase recycled materials from materials recovery facilities or similar entities at market prices if producers are interested in obtaining recycled feedstock directly from these entities to achieve minimum postconsumer recycled content rates.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">c. Each product stewardship plan shall include a budget designed to fully fund the costs necessary to implement the provisions of the plan. The budget shall identify, at a minimum:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the amount of funding needed and available to finance actions and investments identified in the product stewardship plan and actions and investments designed to address the issues identified in a Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill); and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the costs actually or expected to be incurred:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) by local governments, service providers, and other collection programs in association with the implementation of the product stewardship plan and the provisions of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) by the PRO for the reimbursement of service providers for services provided under the plan;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) in association with consumer outreach and education efforts undertaken as part of the product stewardship plan; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) in association with the transportation of covered products to a recycling center, broker, or viable and responsible end market;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) in association with the cleaning, sorting, aggregating, and baling of covered products, as necessary to bring those materials to a viable and responsible end market;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) in association with the administration and operation of the producer responsibility organization; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) in association with the surcharge imposed pursuant to section 10 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">d. The budget developed under this section shall be evaluated by an independent financial auditor, as designated by the department, to ensure that the budget is sufficient to cover all of the costs associated with implementation of the stewardship plan.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">e. (1) A product stewardship plan shall provide a methodology for reimbursement to service providers that provide collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, recovering, preparing, reuse, recycling, composting, or other waste-reduction services for covered materials, exclusive of exempt materials. The methodology shall consider estimated revenue received by service providers from the sale of materials based upon relevant material indices and incorporate relevant cost information identified by the needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). Reimbursement rates shall be annually updated and shall reflect the net costs expended by service providers, at a minimum. Reimbursement rates shall be established equivalent to net costs as established by a methodology in an approved plan as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) no less than 50 percent of the net cost no later than three years after the date of plan approval;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) no less than 75 percent of the net cost no later than four years after the date of plan approval; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) no less than 90 percent of the net cost no later than five years after the date of plan approval, and each year thereafter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Reimbursement rates shall be based on the following, as applicable to the services provided:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) the cost to collect covered materials for recycling, a proportional share of composting, or reuse, adjusted to reflect conditions that affect those costs, varied by region or jurisdiction in which the services are provided, including but not limited to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) the number and type of persons or locations that are serviced by the service provider;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the population density of the service area;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) the collections methods employed;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) the distance traveled by collection vehicles to consolidation or transfer facilities; to reuse, recycling, or composting facilities; and to responsible end markets;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(v) other factors that may contribute to regional or jurisdictional cost differences;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(vi) the proportion of compostable materials within all source-separated compostable materials collected or managed through composting; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(vii) the general quality of the materials collected by the service provider;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the cost to transfer collected covered products from consolidation or transfer facilities to reuse, processing, recycling, or composting facilities or to responsible end markets;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) the cost to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) sort and process covered products for sale or use and remove contamination from the materials by a recycling or composting facility, less the average fair market value for that covered material based on market indices for the region; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) manage contamination removed from collected covered products;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) the administrative costs of service providers, including education, public awareness campaigns, and outreach program costs as applicable; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) the costs of covered services for a refill system or covered services provided for reusable covered products and management of contamination.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) A service provider may retain all revenue from the sale of covered products. Nothing in P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall restrict a service provider from charging a fee for services, to the extent that reimbursement from a producer responsibility organization does not cover all costs of services, including continued investment and innovation in operations, operating profits, and returns on investments required by a service provider to provide sustainability of the services.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">f. A PRO or producer, as applicable, shall annually raise sufficient revenue to fully fund all costs identified in its budget. For a PRO, the revenue shall be raised through a system of fees imposed on producers that are members of a producer responsibility organization. The fee system shall impose fees on producers in proportion to the amount, measured by weight, of covered products sold, offered for sale, imported, or distributed in or into the State by the producer. In addition, the fee system shall impose fees that are proportional to the environmental impact of the covered products, consistent with the following provisions:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) covered products that are certified as being reusable or reused shall be levied the lowest fee possible that covers the cost of the product&#39;s reuse system;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) covered products that are composed of recycled content, are recyclable, or are compostable shall be levied a reduced fee;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the fees shall be inversely proportional to the percentage of recycled content in the products, and the ease of recycling the products;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the fees shall be proportional to the amount of virgin material used in the products, and the percentage of non-compostable materials, including plastic, in the product;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) the presence of hazardous materials in the products, as identified by the Department of Health or the department, shall be associated with a higher fee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) the incorporation of elements, including, but not limited to, inks, labels, and adhesives, that prevent an otherwise recyclable or compostable product from being recyclable or compostable, as applicable, shall be associated with a higher fee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">g. A product stewardship plan may include a system to credit producers for source reduction efforts carried out during the five-year period immediately preceding the baseline year established pursuant to subsection a. of section 6 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The credit system, and the associated source reduction efforts, shall be documented and described in detail in the product stewardship plan and shall take into consideration the environmental impacts of the source reduction efforts as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) switching from single-use packaging products to a reusable or refillable format shall be granted the highest credit;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) switching from non-recyclable packaging products to recyclable or compostable materials shall be granted a lower credit;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) reducing the amount of packaging, measured by average weight and volume of packaging per product sold, offered for sale, or distributed into the State shall be granted a lower credit; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) switching from packaging products that were recyclable or compostable to a single-use plastic material shall be excluded from the credit system.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">8. (New section) a. Not more than 120 days after receipt of a completed product stewardship plan, submitted pursuant to section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), the commissioner shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the plan and provide written notice of the determination to the PRO or producer, as applicable. If the commissioner does not provide written notice of the determination made pursuant to this section within the timeframe specified by this subsection, the plan shall be deemed to have been approved, and the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall proceed to implement the plan as provided by paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section. In making a determination pursuant to this section, the commissioner may solicit information from the representatives of recycling facilities and other stakeholders as the commissioner deems appropriate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">b. A stewardship plan shall not be approved, pursuant to this section, unless the commissioner determines that: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the PRO or producer, as applicable, has engaged in satisfactory consultation with stakeholders in the development of the plan; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the plan adequately addresses all of the elements described in subsection b. of section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the objectives of the plan will be met; and </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the plan contains an adequate financing mechanism, developed pursuant to subsection f. of section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and a budget that has been verified by an independent financial auditor. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">c. (1) If a product stewardship plan is approved pursuant to this section, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the approved plan within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner&#39;s written notice or after the expiration of the 120-day period established by subsection a. of this section, as the case may be, or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If a product stewardship plan is conditionally approved pursuant to this section, the commissioner&#39;s written notice shall specify the conditions that are to be satisfied in order for the plan to be deemed approved pursuant to P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). The PRO or producer, as applicable, shall implement the conditionally approved plan, in accordance with the conditions specified in the notice, either within 90 days after receipt of the commissioner&#39;s notice or within another timeframe agreed to by the commissioner.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If a product stewardship plan is disapproved pursuant to this section, the commissioner&#39;s written notice shall be accompanied by a detailed statement describing the reasons for disapproval. Not more than 30 days after receipt of the commissioner&#39;s notice and accompanying statement of the reasons for disapproval, the PRO or producer, as applicable, shall submit a revised product stewardship plan to the commissioner, who shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove of the revised plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection a. of this section. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">d. Not more than 90 days after approving a product stewardship plan pursuant to this section, or any revisions thereto, the commissioner shall post the plan at a publicly accessible location on the department&#39;s Internet website, together with a list of the producers participating in the plan and a list of the products covered thereunder. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">e. (1) A stewardship plan approved pursuant to this section shall be reviewed and updated by the PRO or producer, as applicable, and reapproved by the commissioner, at least once every five years, in accordance with the procedures specified in this section. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection to the contrary, the commissioner may, at any time, review a previously approved product stewardship plan to determine whether the plan is being implemented in accordance with the provisions of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). If the commissioner, at any time, finds that the approved plan, as implemented, is deficient, the commissioner may order the PRO or producer, as applicable, to incorporate modifications to the plan or to the implementation thereof, as may be necessary to ensure that the plan, as implemented, fully complies with the provisions of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">9. (New section) a. No later than 18 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), and annually thereafter, a service provider seeking reimbursement for services provided under an approved product stewardship plan pursuant to section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) shall register with the department by submitting the following information:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the contact information for a person representing the service provider;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the address of the service provider; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) if applicable to services provided, a report of the total amount billed for collection, processing services, and transfer station operations provided during the preceding calendar year and, when possible, values shall be separated for collection, transfer, and processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">b. A service provider receiving reimbursement or funding under an approved product stewardship plan shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) provide collecting, transferring, transporting, sorting, processing, recovering, preparing, reuse, recycling, composting, or other waste-reduction services for covered products, as applicable to the services offered by, and the service area of, the service provider;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) register with the department pursuant to subsection a. of this section;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) submit invoices to the producer responsibility organization for reimbursement for services rendered as provided in section 7 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) meet any performance standards established in the applicable approved product stewardship plan;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) ensure that covered products are sent to responsible end markets;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) provide documentation to the producer responsibility organization on the amounts of covered products, measured by weight, types of covered products, and volumes of materials processed, sorted by service method;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) display the service provider&#39;s price, minus the reimbursement from the producer responsibility organization, as determined in section 7 of P.L., c.

The balance is what the service provider may charge the customer; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) comply with all other applicable requirements of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">10. (New section) a. There is established the &quot;Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; as a separate, non-lapsing fund in the Department of the Treasury. The &quot;Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; shall be credited with all surcharges, interest, penalties, and other amounts collected and paid to the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury pursuant to this section. Moneys in the &quot;Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund&quot; shall be expended only to: (1) fund efforts identified in a Statewide needs assessment carried out pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), in the form of grants or low-interest loans issued by the department; (2) to administer or enforce the provisions of sections 1 through 17 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), including the transfer of moneys into the General Fund to repay moneys expended by the department or any other State agency during fiscal years prior to the deposit of moneys in the fund; or (3) to otherwise implement an approved product stewardship plan. Prior to making an expenditure from the fund, the department shall consult with the producer responsibility organization approved pursuant to P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) and shall follow the recommendations of the producer responsibility organization regarding expenditures from the fund, provided that the department determines that the expenditures are in the public interest, and that any producer responsibility organization seeking grant moneys from the fund is in compliance with the financial responsibility provisions of paragraph (3) of subsection d. of section 4 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill). </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">b. Pending the use thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section, the monies deposited in the fund shall be held in interest-bearing accounts in public depositories, as defined pursuant to section 1 of P.L.1970, c.236 (C.17:9-41), and may be invested or reinvested in such securities as are approved by the State Treasurer. Interest or other income earned on monies deposited into the fund shall be credited to the fund for use as set forth in P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill) for other monies in the fund.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">c. Commencing 30 months after the completion of the Statewide needs assessment pursuant to section 5 of P.L., c. (C. ) (pending before the Legislature as this bill), each producer responsibility organization and non-participating producer shall pay an annual surcharge as assessed by the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the Treasury, to be deposited in the &quot;Packaging and Paper Reduction and Recycling Fund.&quot; The total amount of the surcharge shall be the lesser of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the amount of funding required during the next fiscal year to fund the costs of solid waste and recycling infrastructure and systems upgrades needed for producers to meet the requirements of section 6 of P.L., c.
