This chapter shall not preclude a person from bringing a civil or criminal\naction under any other provision of law.\n\nEXPLANATION\n\nThe inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement withthe\nexplanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.\n\nThis bill relates to restrictions on the use of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe bill defines \"application\" as a software program designed for an\nelectronic device to enable a user to perform a particular task or set of\nrelated tasks including but not limited to checking the weather, playing\ngames, accessing social media, or managing personal information, within the\ncapabilities of the electronic device.\n\nThe bill defines \"artificial intelligence\" as any machine-based system that,\nfor any explicit or implicit objective, infers from the inputs the system\nreceives to generate outputs, including content, decisions, predictions, or\nrecommendations, that can influence physical or virtual environments.\n\nThe bill defines \"developer\" as a person who, in this state, creates or\nsubstantially modifies AI or an application (app) that uses AI.\n\nThe bill defines \"device company\" as a person engaged in the business of\nmanufacturing smart devices and that has a registered office, a registered\nagent, or a business office in this state. \"Device company\" includes a\nregistrant as defined in Code section 548.101, that engages in the business of\nmanufacturing smart devices.\n\nThe bill defines \"initialize\" as the process of starting a smart device and\nassociate the smart device with a new user account.\n\nThe bill defines \"private data\" as data that AI, or an app that includes AI,\naccesses on a smart device, and that is not content generated by using the AI\nor the app on the smart device, or content to which the AI's developer or the\napp's developer had previously received authorization to access for purposes\ndescribed in the smart device's statement of purpose or the app's statement of\npurpose.\n\nThe bill defines \"smart device\" as a computer, smartphone, gaming console,\ntablet computer, or other electronic device capable of running software to\ndownload, install, or use AI and that was sold in this state on or after July\n1, 2025.\n\nThe bill defines \"statement of purpose\" as a statement made for an app or\nsmart device that explains the types of private data the app or smart device\nwas designed to access; how the private data will be used, including the types\nof new content the private data will be used to generate and how the new\ncontent will be used; and if the app or smart device is designed to save,\ncopy, or otherwise transfer private data to a location outside the smart\ndevice, an explanation of how and where private data will be maintained,\ndisseminated, and deleted, as applicable.\n\nIf a device company makes a smart device available for purchase with AI\ninstalled on the smart device, the bill requires the device company to cause\nan agreement to appear when a user initializes the smart device. The agreement\nmust contain a notice to the smart device's user that the smart device has AI\ninstalled on the smart device; if the smart device's AI is designed to access\nthe user's private data, the smart device's statement of purpose (SOP); and an\noption to uninstall the AI. If the smart device's user does not uninstall the\nAI, the device company needs to cause an interactive form to appear that will\nallow the smart device's user to refuse the smart device's AI access to each\ntype of private data the AI is designed to access on the smart device prior to\nthe AI accessing the private data. The agreement must be separate from any\nother agreement or disclaimer the device company requires or is required to\ncreate for the smart device, including but not limited to terms of service\nagreements and end user license agreements.\n\nIf a device company changes any information contained in the SOP for a smart\ndevice, the bill requires the device company to update the agreement\ncontaining the smart device's SOP, and cause the updated agreement to appear\non each smart device affected by the change and which has not authorized or\nrefused access to private data based on the change.\n\nIf a device company causes AI to be installed on a smart device the device\ncompany manufactured, the bill prohibits the device company from permitting\nthe AI installed on the smart device to access a type of private data that the\nAI was not authorized to access in an agreement containing the smart device's\nSOP; using private data accessed by the AI in a manner that is not stated in\nthe smart device's SOP; if the AI saves, copies, or otherwise transfers\nprivate data to a location outside a smart device from which the private data\noriginated, maintaining, disseminating, or deleting the private data in a\nmanner that is inconsistent with the smart device's SOP.\n\nThe bill contains provisions for an app developer which are similar to the\nrequirements and prohibitions for a device company if the app developer makes\nan app that includes AI available for general use and the app is designed to\naccess private data.\n\nThe bill prohibits a device company from requiring a smart device user to\ninstall AI on the smart device as a condition to use the smart device.\n\nThe bill requires a device company to include clearly identifiable means to\nallow a user to uninstall artificial intelligence from a smart device if the\nartificial intelligence was installed on the smart device due to an action\ntaken by the device company.\n\nThe bill prohibits a person from using AI to intentionally recreate the audio\nor visual likeness of an individual without the consent of the individual if\nthe likeness was intended to be substantially indistinguishable from the\nindividual and the likeness is used in commercial activity; a political\ncampaign which the individual does not support; a manner intended to make\nother persons believe that the individual engages in activities the individual\nwould reasonably find offensive; a manner intended to diminish the\nindividual's credibility, cause embarrassment, or otherwise lower the\nindividual's esteem within the individual's community; or a manner intended to\ninduce a person to take an action or divulge information the person otherwise\nwould not.\n\nThe bill allows a person to bring an action for actual damages and punitive\ndamages for a violation of the bill, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs.\nPunitive damages cannot exceed $250,000 per violation.\n\nThe bill allows persons to bring class actions in accordance with the Iowa\nrules of civil procedure for violations of the bill.\n\nThe bill requires the court to specify the amount of actual damages, punitive\ndamages, court costs, and reasonable attorney fees for each violation of the\nnew Code chapter. The bill lists several factors a court must consider when\ndetermining the amount of punitive damages under the new Code chapter. A\ndevice company is considered to have committed a separate violation for each\nsmart device manufactured on or after July 1, 2025, that is initialized in\nthis state. A developer is considered to have committed a separate violation\nfor each smart device that uses the developer's AI or app on or after July 1,\n2025, in this state. A person is considered to have committed a separate\nviolation for each day a likeness is used in violation of the bill.\n\nThe bill does not preclude a person from bringing an action under any other\nprovision of law.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
