These subsequent evaluations shall be conducted by an evaluator. The consulting teacher shall provide advice to the teacher rated &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; on how to improve teaching skills and to successfully complete the remediation plan. The consulting teacher shall participate in developing the remediation plan, but the final decision as to the evaluation shall be done solely by the evaluator, unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides to the contrary.

Districts and teachers subject to dismissal hearings are precluded from compelling the testimony of consulting teachers at such hearings under subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code, either as to the rating process or for opinions of performances by teachers under remediation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(n) After the implementation date of an evaluation system for teachers in a district as specified in Section 24A-2.5 of this Code, if a teacher in contractual continued service successfully completes a remediation plan following a rating of &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in an overall performance evaluation received after the foregoing implementation date and receives a subsequent rating of &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; in any of the teacher&#39;s overall performance evaluation ratings received during the 36-month period following the teacher&#39;s completion of the remediation plan, then the school district may forgo remediation and seek dismissal in accordance with subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 34-85 of this Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(o) Teachers who are due to be evaluated in the last year before they are set to retire shall be offered the opportunity to waive their evaluation and to retain their most recent rating, unless the teacher was last rated as &quot;needs improvement&quot; or &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;.
