and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, The more than 3,000,000 classified workers nationwide are the frontline workers who transform schools in the United States from brick and mortar buildings to places of learning and support for more than 49,000,000 pupils across the United States; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, national school staff employment has fallen, and schools employ 331,000 fewer classified workers than before, leaving schools without the necessary staff in almost every position; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, A crisis in the staffing of teachers has resulted in some classified workers being expected to assume the duties of certificated teachers without commensurate compensation or benefits; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Many classified workers are severely undercompensated for their work and do not receive anything close to a living wage, much less a competitive wage compared to the existing labor market that is a family-sustaining living wage;

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Classified workers often serve pupils facing systemic barriers, but they are often excluded from professional growth and development opportunities; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, Similar to many school employees, classified workers are too frequently subject to workplace violence and other safety hazards, including contaminants and extreme temperatures;
