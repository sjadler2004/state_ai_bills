law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public benefit corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other public transportation systems in payment of state operating assistance or such lesser amount as the authority or public transportation system shall make application for, shall be paid by the commissioner of transportation to such authority or public transportation system in lieu, and in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the reporting date provision of section 17-a of the transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authority and other major public transportation systems receiving mass transportation operating assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transportation. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with the chairpersons of the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means committee and the director of the budget. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public transportation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivision 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner and at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and where payment is not made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching payments required of any city, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company shall be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating assistance pursuant to this section or on such other basis as may be agreed upon by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the budget, and the chief executive officer of such city, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually evaluate the operating and financial performance of each major public transportation system. Where the commissioner&#39;s evaluation process has identified a problem related to system performance, the commissioner may request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficiencies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public transportation systems or private operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other information as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the evaluation process. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Payments shall be made contingent upon compliance with regulations deemed necessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the commissioner of transportation and approved by the director of the budget, which shall promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated service delivery of public transportation systems. The chief executive officer of each public transportation system receiving a payment shall certify to the commissioner of transportation, in addition to information required by section 18-b of the transportation law, such other information as the commissioner of transportation shall determine is necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Counties, municipalities or Indian tribes that propose to allocate service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by the service payment formula shall be required to describe the proposed method of distributing governmental operating aid and submit it one month prior to the start of the operator&#39;s fiscal year to the commissioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only approve alternate distribution methods which are consistent with the transportation needs of the people to be served and ensure that the system of private operators does not exceed established maximum service payment limits. Copies of such approvals shall be submitted to the chairpersons of the senate finance and assembly ways and means committees. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the transportation law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to continue to use prior quarter statistics to determine current quarter payment amounts, as initiated in the April to June quarter of 1981. In the event that actual revenue passengers and actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quarter, estimated statistics may be used as the basis of payment upon approval by the commissioner of transportation. In such event, the succeeding payment shall be adjusted to reflect the difference between the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle, nautical or car miles used as the basis of the estimated payment.

The corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in their discretion believes that any such person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the surcharge, penalty or interest might be satisfied, and that any such surcharge, penalty or interest will not be paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare such surcharge, penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the city sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the surcharge, which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the surcharge, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which such city sheriff may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefore and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) The commissioner of finance, if such commissioner finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid surcharges, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.

Such penalties and interest shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid penalties and interest may be enforced in the same manner as the surcharge imposed by this chapter.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Any person failing to keep the records required by subdivision (c) of section 11-3203 of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one hundred dollars per day from the date on which a determination has been made that any such person failed to keep any such records until the date on which such records are provided, provided that such period shall be no greater than three years. It shall not be any defense to an action under this subdivision that the failure to keep the records was unintentional or not willful.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) The certificate of the commissioner of transportation to the effect that a surcharge has not been paid or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) Any person failing to submit the required permit application for a construction permit and who fails to pay the surcharge authorized by the provisions of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be subject to a civil penalty in an amount no greater than ten percent of such surcharge.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Section 11-3211 Notices and limitations of time.

Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;private activity bond allocation act of 2025&quot;. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2. Legislative findings and declaration. The legislature hereby finds and declares that the federal tax reform act of 1986 established a statewide bond volume ceiling on the issuance of certain tax exempt private activity bonds and notes and, under certain circumstances, governmental use bonds and notes issued by the state and its public authorities, local governments, agencies which issue on behalf of local governments, and certain other issuers. The federal tax reform act establishes a formula for the allocation of the bond volume ceiling which was subject to temporary modification by gubernatorial executive order until December 31, 1987. That act also permits state legislatures to establish, by statute, an alternative formula for allocating the volume ceiling. Bonds and notes subject to the volume ceiling require an allocation from the state&#39;s annual volume ceiling in order to qualify for federal tax exemption. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to maximize the public benefit through the issuance of private activity bonds for the purposes of, among other things, allocating a fair share of the bond volume ceiling upon initial allocation and from a bond reserve to local agencies and for needs identified by local governments; providing housing and promoting economic development; job creation; an economical energy supply; and resource recovery and to provide for an orderly and efficient volume ceiling allocation process for state and local agencies by establishing an alternative formula for making such allocations. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.

Local agency set-aside. A set-aside of statewide ceiling for local agencies for any calendar year shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to one-third of the statewide ceiling as the population of the jurisdiction of such local agency bears to the population of the entire state. The commissioner shall administer allocations of such set-aside to local agencies. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 5. State agency set-aside. A set-aside of statewide ceiling for all state agencies for any calendar year shall be one-third of the statewide ceiling.

The remainder of the statewide bond reserve may be allocated by the director to state agencies in accordance with the terms of this section. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. Allocation of statewide bond reserve to local agencies or other issuers. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Local agencies or other issuers may at any time apply to the commissioner for an allocation from the statewide bond reserve. Such application shall demonstrate: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) that the requested allocation is required under the code for the interest earned on the bonds to be excluded from the gross income of bondholders for federal income tax purposes; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) that the local agency&#39;s remaining unused allocation provided pursuant to section four of this act, and other issuer&#39;s remaining unused allocation, or any available carryforward will be insufficient for the specific project or projects for which the reserve allocation is requested; and </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) that, except for those allocations made pursuant to section thirteen of this act to enable carryforward elections, the requested allocation is reasonably expected to be used during the calendar year, and the requested future allocation is reasonably expected to be used in the calendar year to which the future allocation relates. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) In reviewing and approving or disapproving applications, the commissioner shall exercise discretion to ensure an equitable distribution of allocations from the statewide bond reserve to local agencies and other issuers. Prior to making a determination on such applications, the commissioner shall notify and seek the recommendation of the president and chief executive officer of the New York state housing finance agency in the case of an application related to the issuance of multifamily housing or mortgage revenue bonds, and in the case of other requests, such state officers, departments, divisions and agencies as the commissioner deems appropriate. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Applications for allocations shall be made in such form and contain such information and reports as the commissioner shall require. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) On or before September fifteenth of each year, the commissioner shall publish the total amount of local agency set-aside that has been recaptured pursuant to section twelve of this act for that year on the department of economic development&#39;s website. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. Allocation of statewide bond reserve to state agencies. The director may make an allocation from the statewide bond reserve to any state agency. Before making any allocation of statewide bond reserve to state agencies the director shall be satisfied: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) that the allocation is required under the code for the interest earned on the bonds to be excluded from the gross income of bondholders for federal income tax purposes; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) that the state agency&#39;s remaining unused allocation provided pursuant to section five of this act or any available carryforward will be insufficient to accommodate the specific bond issue or issues for which the reserve allocation is requested; and </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) that, except for those allocations made pursuant to section thirteen of this act to enable carryforward elections, the requested allocation is reasonably expected to be used during the calendar year, and the requested future allocation is reasonably expected to be used in the calendar year to which the future allocation relates. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 7. Access to employment opportunities. 1. All issuers shall require that any new employment opportunities created in connection with industrial or manufacturing projects financed through the issuance of qualified small issue bonds shall be listed with the New York state department of labor and with the one-stop career center established pursuant to the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. No. 113-128) serving the locality in which the employment opportunities are being created. Such listing shall be in a manner and form prescribed by the commissioner. All issuers shall further require that for any new employment opportunities created in connection with an industrial or manufacturing project financed through the issuance of qualified small issue bonds by such issuer, industrial or manufacturing firms shall first consider persons eligible to participate in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Pub. L. No. 113-128) programs who shall be referred to the industrial or manufacturing firm by one-stop centers in local workforce investment areas or by the department of labor. Issuers of qualified small issue bonds are required to monitor compliance with the provisions of this section as prescribed by the commissioner. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require users of qualified small issue bonds to violate any existing collective bargaining agreement with respect to the hiring of new employees. Failure on the part of any user of qualified small issue bonds to comply with the requirements of this section shall not affect the allocation of bonding authority to the issuer of the bonds or the validity or tax exempt status of such bonds. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 8. Overlapping jurisdictions. In a geographic area represented by a county local agency and one or more sub-county local agencies, the allocation granted by section four of this act with respect to such area of overlapping jurisdiction shall be apportioned one-half to the county local agency and one-half to the sub-county local agency or agencies. Where there is a local agency for the benefit of a village within the geographic area of a town for the benefit of which there is a local agency, the allocation of the village local agency shall be based on the population of the geographic area of the village, and the allocation of the town local agency shall be based upon the population of the geographic area of the town outside of the village. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a local agency may surrender all or part of its allocation for such calendar year to another local agency with an overlapping jurisdiction. Such surrender shall be made at such time and in such manner as the commissioner shall prescribe. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 9. Ineligible local agencies. To the extent that any allocation of the local agency set-aside would be made by this act to a local agency which is ineligible to receive such allocation under the code or under regulations interpreting the state volume ceiling provisions of the code, such allocation shall instead be made to the political subdivision for whose benefit that local agency was created. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 10. Municipal reallocation. The chief executive officer of any political subdivision or, if such political subdivision has no chief executive officer, the governing board of the political subdivision for the benefit of which a local agency has been established, may withdraw all or any portion of the allocation granted by section four of this act to such local agency. The political subdivision may then reallocate all or any portion of such allocation, as well as all or any portion of the allocation received pursuant to section nine of this act, to itself or any other issuer established for the benefit of that political subdivision or may assign all or any portion of the allocation received pursuant to section nine of this act to the local agency created for its benefit. The chief executive officer or governing board of the political subdivision, as the case may be, shall notify the commissioner of any such reallocation. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 11. Future allocations for multi-year housing development projects. 1. In addition to other powers granted under this act, the commissioner is authorized to make the following future allocations of statewide ceiling for any multi-year housing development project for which the commissioner also makes an allocation of statewide ceiling for the current year under this act or for which, in the event of expiration of provisions of this act described in section eighteen of this act, an allocation of volume cap for a calendar year subsequent to such expiration shall have been made under section 146 of the code: (a) to local agencies from the local agency set-aside (but only with the approval of the chief executive officer of the political subdivision to which the local agency set-aside relates or the governing body of a political subdivision having no chief executive officer) and (b) to other issuers from that portion, if any, of the statewide bond reserve transferred to the commissioner by the director. Any future allocation made by the commissioner shall constitute an allocation of statewide ceiling for the future year specified by the commissioner and shall be deemed to have been made on the first day of the future year so specified. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. In addition to other powers granted under this act, the director is authorized to make future allocations of statewide ceiling from the state agency set-aside or from the statewide bond reserve to state agencies for any multi-year housing development project for which the director also makes an allocation of statewide ceiling from the current year under this act or for which, in the event of expiration of provisions of this act described in section eighteen of this act, an allocation of volume cap for a calendar year subsequent to such expiration shall have been made under section 146 of the code, and is authorized to make transfers of the statewide bond reserve to the commissioner for future allocations to other issuers for multi-year housing development projects for which the commissioner has made an allocation of statewide ceiling for the current year. Any such future allocation or transfer of the statewide bond reserve for future allocation made by the director shall constitute an allocation of statewide ceiling or transfer of the statewide bond reserve for the future years specified by the director and shall be deemed to have been made on the first day of the future year so specified. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. (a) If an allocation made with respect to a multi-year housing development project is not used by September fifteenth of the year to which the allocation relates, the allocation with respect to the then current year shall be subject to recapture in accordance with the provisions of section twelve of this act, and in the event of such a recapture, unless a carryforward election by another issuer shall have been approved by the commissioner or a carryforward election by a state agency shall have been approved by the director, all future allocations made with respect to such project pursuant to subdivision one or two of this section shall be canceled. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The commissioner and the director shall have the authority to make future allocations from recaptured current year allocations and canceled future allocations to multi-year housing development projects in a manner consistent with the provisions of this act. Any such future allocation shall, unless a carryforward election by another issuer shall have been approved by the commissioner or a carryforward election by a state agency shall have been approved by the director, be canceled if the current year allocation for the project is not used by December 31, 2026. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The commissioner and the director shall establish procedures consistent with the provisions of this act relating to carryforward of future allocations. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">4. The aggregate future allocations from either of the two succeeding years shall not exceed six hundred fifty million dollars for each such year. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 12. Year end allocation recapture. On or before September first of each year, each state agency shall report to the director and each local agency and each other issuer shall report to the commissioner the amount of bonds subject to allocation under this act that will be issued prior to the end of the then current calendar year, and the amount of the issuer&#39;s then total allocation that will remain unused. As of September fifteenth of each year, the unused portion of each local agency&#39;s and other issuer&#39;s then total allocation as reported and the unallocated portion of the set-aside for state agencies shall be recaptured and added to the statewide bond reserve and shall no longer be available to covered bond issuers except as otherwise provided herein. From September fifteenth through the end of the year, each local agency or other issuer having an allocation shall immediately report to the commissioner and each state agency having an allocation shall immediately report to the director any changes to the status of its allocation or the status of projects for which allocations have been made which should affect the timing or likelihood of the issuance of covered bonds therefor. If the commissioner determines that a local agency or other issuer has overestimated the amount of covered bonds subject to allocation that will be issued prior to the end of the calendar year, the commissioner may recapture the amount of the allocation to such local agency or other issuer represented by such overestimation by notice to the local agency or other issuer, and add such allocation to the statewide bond reserve. The director may likewise make such determination and recapture with respect to state agency allocations. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 13. Allocation carryforward. 1. No local agency or other issuer shall make a carryforward election utilizing any unused allocation (pursuant to section 146(f) of the code) without the prior approval of the commissioner.

Statement of legislative findings and intent. It is hereby found and declared that agricultural lands are irreplaceable state assets.

External pressures on farm stability such as population growth <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">in non-metropolitan areas</strike>, <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">climate change,</u> lack of access to affordable farmland, and public infrastructure development pose a significant threat to farm operations, yet are the pressures over which farmers have the least control. Local initiatives in agricultural protection policy, facilitated by the agricultural districts program established in article twenty-five-AA of this chapter, have proved effective as a basic step in addressing these pressures. In an effort to encourage further development of agricultural and farmland protection programs, and to recognize both the crucial role that local government plays in developing these strategies, plus the state constitutional directive to the legislature to provide for the protection of agricultural lands, it is therefore declared the policy of the state to promote local initiatives for agricultural and farmland protection. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2.

Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary,\npayment of mass transportation operating assistance pursuant to section 18-b\nof the transportation law shall be subject to the provisions contained herein\nand the amounts made available therefor by appropriation.\n\nIn establishing service and usage formulas for distribution of mass\ntransportation operating assistance, the commissioner of transportation may\ncombine and/or take into consideration those formulas used to distribute mass\ntransportation operating assistance payments authorized by separate\nappropriations in order to facilitate program administration and to ensure an\norderly distribution of such funds.\n\nTo improve the predictability in the level of funding for those systems\nreceiving operating assistance payments under service and usage formulas, the\ncommissioner of transportation is authorized with the approval of the director\nof the budget, to provide service payments based on service and usage\nstatistics of the preceding year.\n\nIn the case of a service payment made, pursuant to section 18-b of the\ntransportation law, to a regional transportation authority on account of mass\ntransportation services provided to more than one county (considering the city\nof New York to be one county), the respective shares of the matching payments\nrequired to be made by a county to any such authority shall be as follows:\n\n| Percentage |   \n---|---|---  \n| of Matching |   \nLocal Jurisdiction | Payment |   \n\\-------------------------------- | \\------------ |   \nIn the Metropolitan Commuter |  |   \nTransportation District: |  |   \nNew York City ................ | 6.4 |   \nDutchess ..................... | 1.3 |   \nNassau ....................... | 39.6 |   \nOrange ....................... | 0.5 |   \nPutnam ....................... | 1.3 |   \nRockland ..................... | 0.1 |   \nSuffolk ...................... | 25.7 |   \nWestchester .................. | 25.1 |   \nIn the Capital District Trans- |  |   \nportation District: |  |   \nAlbany ....................... | 54.05 |   \nRensselaer ................... | 22.45 |   \nSaratoga ..................... | 3.95 |   \nSchenectady .................. | 15.9 |   \nMontgomery ................... | 1.44 |   \nWarren ....................... | 2.21 |   \nIn the Central New York Re- |  |   \ngional Transportation Dis- |  |   \ntrict: |  |   \nCayuga ....................... |  ~~5.11~~ _5.05_ |   \nOnondaga ..................... |  ~~75.83~~ _74.94_ |   \nOswego ....................... |  ~~2.85~~ _2.82_ |   \nOneida ....................... |  ~~16.21~~ _16.02_ |   \n_Cortland....................._ |  _1.17_ |   \nIn the Rochester-Genesee Re- |  |   \ngional Transportation Dis- |  |   \ntrict: |  |   \nGenesee ...................... | 1.36 |   \nLivingston ................... | 0.9 |   \nMonroe ....................... | 90.14 |   \nWayne ........................ | 0.98 |   \nWyoming ...................... | 0.51 |   \nSeneca ....................... | 0.64 |   \nOrleans ...................... | 0.77 |   \nOntario ...................... | 4.69 |   \nIn the Niagara Frontier Trans- |  |   \nportation District: Erie .. | ....................... | 89.2  \nNiagara ...................... | 10.8 |   \n  \nNotwithstanding any other inconsistent provisions of section 18-b of the\ntransportation law or any other law, any moneys provided to a public benefit\ncorporation constituting a transportation authority or to other public\ntransportation systems in payment of state operating assistance or such lesser\namount as the authority or public transportation system shall make application\nfor, shall be paid by the commissioner of transportation to such authority or\npublic transportation system in lieu, and in full satisfaction, of any amounts\nwhich the authority would otherwise be entitled to receive under section 18-b\nof the transportation law.\n\nNotwithstanding the reporting date provision of section 17-a of the\ntransportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authority and\nother major public transportation systems receiving mass transportation\noperating assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15 of each year in\nthe format prescribed by the commissioner of transportation. Copies of such\nreports shall also be filed with the chairpersons of the senate finance\ncommittee and the assembly ways and means committee and the director of the\nbudget. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state operating\nassistance payments to public transportation systems or private operators that\ndo not provide such reports.\n\nPayments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivision 2 of\nsection 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner and at such\nother times as the commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the\ndirector of the budget, may provide; and where payment is not made in the\nmanner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching payments required of any\ncity, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company shall be made within 30\ndays of the payment of state operating assistance pursuant to this section or\non such other basis as may be agreed upon by the commissioner of\ntransportation, the director of the budget, and the chief executive officer of\nsuch city, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company.\n\nThe commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually evaluate the\noperating and financial performance of each major public transportation\nsystem. Where the commissioner's evaluation process has identified a problem\nrelated to system performance, the commissioner may request the system to\ndevelop plans to address the performance deficiencies. The commissioner of\ntransportation may withhold future state operating assistance payments to\npublic transportation systems or private operators that do not provide such\noperating, financial, or other information as may be required by the\ncommissioner to conduct the evaluation process.\n\nPayments shall be made contingent upon compliance with regulations deemed\nnecessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the commissioner of transportation\nand approved by the director of the budget, which shall promote the economy,\nefficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated service delivery of public\ntransportation systems. The chief executive officer of each public\ntransportation system receiving a payment shall certify to the commissioner of\ntransportation, in addition to information required by section 18-b of the\ntransportation law, such other information as the commissioner of\ntransportation shall determine is necessary to determine compliance and carry\nout the purposes herein.\n\nCounties, municipalities or Indian tribes that propose to allocate service\npayments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by the service\npayment formula shall be required to describe the proposed method of\ndistributing governmental operating aid and submit it one month prior to the\nstart of the operator's fiscal year to the commissioner of transportation in\nwriting for review and approval prior to the distribution of state aid. The\ncommissioner of transportation shall only approve alternate distribution\nmethods which are consistent with the transportation needs of the people to be\nserved and ensure that the system of private operators does not exceed\nestablished maximum service payment limits.

In the event that\nactual revenue passengers and actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car\nmiles are not available for the preceding quarter, estimated statistics may be\nused as the basis of payment upon approval by the commissioner of\ntransportation. In such event, the succeeding payment shall be adjusted to\nreflect the difference between the actual and estimated total number of\nrevenue passengers and vehicle, nautical or car miles used as the basis of the\nestimated payment. The chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the\nsystem is eligible to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to\noperating expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless\notherwise specified by such commissioner. In the event that a public\ntransportation system ceases to participate in the program, operating\nassistance due for the final quarter that service is provided shall be based\nupon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the actual total number\nof vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quarter.\n\nPayments shall be contingent on compliance with audit requirements determined\nby the commissioner of transportation.\n\nIn the event that an audit of a public transportation system or private\noperator receiving funds discloses the existence of an overpayment of state\noperating assistance, regardless of whether such an overpayment results from\nan audit of revenue passengers and the actual number of revenue vehicle miles\nstatistics, or an audit of private operators in cases where more than a\nreasonable return based on equity or operating revenues and expenses has\nresulted, the commissioner of transportation, in addition to recovering the\namount of state operating assistance overpaid, shall also recover interest, as\ndefined by the department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the\noverpayment.\n\nNotwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, whenever\nthe commissioner of transportation is notified by the comptroller that the\namount of revenues available for payment from an account is less than the\ntotal amount of money for which the public mass transportation systems are\neligible pursuant to the provisions of section 88-a of the state finance law\nand any appropriations enacted for these purposes, the commissioner of\ntransportation shall establish a maximum payment limit which is proportionally\nlower than the amounts set forth in appropriations.\n\nNotwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a of the\nstate finance law and any other general or special law, payments may be made\nin quarterly installments or in such other manner and at such other times as\nthe commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the director of the\nbudget may prescribe.\n\nSection 2.

(a) Whenever any person to\nwhom a construction permit has been issued fails to pay the correct and\nsufficient surcharge, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as therein\nprovided, the commissioner of transportation shall notify the commissioner of\nfinance of all relevant records determined necessary by the commissioner of\nfinance to facilitate collection of such surcharge. The corporation counsel\nshall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be\nbrought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of\nNew York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the\nUnited States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in their discretion\nbelieves that any such person is about to cease business, leave the state or\nremove or dissipate the assets out of which the surcharge, penalty or interest\nmight be satisfied, and that any such surcharge, penalty or interest will not\nbe paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare such surcharge,\npenalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant\nimmediately._\n\n_(b) As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may\nissue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the city sheriff to\nlevy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the\nsurcharge, which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount\nthereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the\nwarrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay\nto the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof within\nsixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within\nfive days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy\nthereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name\nof the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the surcharge,\npenalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such\ncopy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a\nlien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the\nperson against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed\nupon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided\nby law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a\ncourt of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff\nshall be entitled to the same fees, which such city sheriff may collect in the\nsame manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of\nlike terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or\nemployee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such\nofficer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs,\nbut shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual\nexpenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not\nsatisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new\nwarrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due\nthereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefore and execution\nthereon had been returned unsatisfied._\n\n_(c) The commissioner of finance, if such commissioner finds that the\ninterests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such\nconditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any\nproperty from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid\nsurcharges, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the\noffice of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The\nclerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of\ndocketing the vacated warrant._\n\n_Section 11-3210 Penalties and interest. (a) Any person failing to pay any\nsurcharge to the commissioner of transportation within the time required by\nthis chapter shall be subject to a penalty of five percent of the amount of\nsurcharge due; plus interest at the rate of one percent of such surcharge for\neach month of delay excepting the first month after such surcharge became due;\nbut the commissioner of transportation if satisfied that the delay was\nexcusable, may remit all or any part of such penalty, but not interest at the\nrate of six percent per year. Such penalties and interest shall be paid and\ndisposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid\npenalties and interest may be enforced in the same manner as the surcharge\nimposed by this chapter._\n\n_(b) Any person failing to keep the records required by subdivision (c) of\nsection 11-3203 of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or\nelsewhere prescribed, be subject to a civil penalty in an amount up to one\nhundred dollars per day from the date on which a determination has been made\nthat any such person failed to keep any such records until the date on which\nsuch records are provided, provided that such period shall be no greater than\nthree years. It shall not be any defense to an action under this subdivision\nthat the failure to keep the records was unintentional or not willful._\n\n_(c) The certificate of the commissioner of transportation to the effect that\na surcharge has not been paid or that information has not been supplied\npursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence\nthereof._\n\n_(d) Any person failing to submit the required permit application for a\nconstruction permit and who fails to pay the surcharge authorized by the\nprovisions of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or\nelsewhere prescribed, be subject to a civil penalty in an amount no greater\nthan ten percent of such surcharge._\n\n_Section 11-3211 Notices and limitations of time. (a) Any notice authorized or\nrequired under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same\nto the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such\nperson at the address given in the construction permit issued to such person\npursuant to the rules of the city of New York or, if no permit has been issued\nto such person, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such\nnotice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person\nto whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the\nprovisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from\nthe date of mailing of such notice._\n\n_(b) The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law\nrelative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall\nnot apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise,\nassess, determine or enforce the collection of any surcharge or penalty\nprovided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a willfully false or\nfraudulently obtained construction permit with intent to evade the surcharge,\nno assessment of additional surcharge shall be made after the expiration of\nmore than three years from the date of the issuance of a construction permit\nor the renewal thereof; provided, however, that where no construction permit\nhas been issued, or where there has been a change relating to the use of the\nstreet for which a construction permit has been issued that would increase the\namount of the surcharge, any additional surcharge may be assessed at any\ntime._\n\nSection 3. Any local law enacted pursuant to the authority of section one of\nthis act shall designate an agency to adopt rules and regulations to implement\nthe provisions of such section.\n\nSection 4. This act shall take effect immediately, except that section two of\nthis act shall take effect January 1, 2028.\n\nPART Q\n\nSection 1.

The commissioner, in\nconsultation with the superintendent of the division of state police, shall\ndetermine the location of the highway construction or maintenance work areas\nlocated on a controlledaccess highway in which to install and operate photo\nspeed violation monitoring systems. In selecting a highway construction or\nmaintenance work area in which to install and operate a photo speed violation\nmonitoring system, the commissioner shall consider criteria including, but not\nlimited to, the speed data, crash history, and roadway geometry applicable to\nsuch highway construction or maintenance work area. A photo speed violation\nmonitoring system shall not be installed or operated on a controlled-access\nhighway exit ramp.\n\n2\\. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, ~~after holding a public\nhearing in accordance with the public officers law and subsequent approval of\nthe establishment of a demonstration program in accordance with this section\nby a majority of the members of the entire board of the thruway authority,~~\nthe chair of the thruway authority is hereby authorized to establish a\n~~demonstration~~ program imposing monetary liability on the owner of a\nvehicle for failure of an operator thereof to comply with posted maximum speed\nlimits in a highway construction or maintenance work area located on the\nthruway (i) when highway construction or maintenance work is occurring and a\nwork area speed limit is in effect as provided in paragraph two of subdivision\n(d) or subdivision (f) of section eleven hundred eighty of this article or\n(ii) when highway construction or maintenance work is occurring and other\nspeed limits are in effect as provided in subdivision (b) or (g) or paragraph\none of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eighty of this article. Such\n~~demonstration~~ program shall empower the chair to install photo speed\nviolation monitoring systems within no more than ten highway construction or\nmaintenance work areas located on the thruway and to operate such systems\nwithin such work areas (iii) when highway construction or maintenance work is\noccurring and a work area speed limit is in effect as provided in paragraph\ntwo of subdivision (d) or subdivision (f) of section eleven hundred eighty of\nthis article or (iv) when highway construction or maintenance work is\noccurring and other speed limits are in effect as provided in subdivision (b)\nor (g) or paragraph one of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eighty of\nthis article. The chair, in consultation with the superintendent of the\ndivision of state police, shall determine the location of the highway\nconstruction or maintenance work areas located on the thruway in which to\ninstall and operate photo speed violation monitoring systems. In selecting a\nhighway construction or maintenance work area in which to install and operate\na photo speed violation monitoring system, the chair shall consider criteria\nincluding, but not limited to, the speed data, crash history, and roadway\ngeometry applicable to such highway construction or maintenance work area. A\nphoto speed violation monitoring system shall not be installed or operated on\na thruway exit ramp.\n\n4\\. Operators of photo speed violation monitoring systems shall have completed\ntraining in the procedures for setting up, testing, and operating such\nsystems. Each such operator shall complete and sign a daily set-up log for\neach such system that ~~he or she~~ _the operator_ operates that (i) states\nthe date and time when, and the location where, the system was set up that\nday, and (ii) states that such operator successfully performed, and the system\npassed, the self-tests of such system before producing a recorded image that\nday.

The legislature hereby finds\nand declares that the federal tax reform act of 1986 established a statewide\nbond volume ceiling on the issuance of certain tax exempt private activity\nbonds and notes and, under certain circumstances, governmental use bonds and\nnotes issued by the state and its public authorities, local governments,\nagencies which issue on behalf of local governments, and certain other\nissuers. The federal tax reform act establishes a formula for the allocation\nof the bond volume ceiling which was subject to temporary modification by\ngubernatorial executive order until December 31, 1987. That act also permits\nstate legislatures to establish, by statute, an alternative formula for\nallocating the volume ceiling. Bonds and notes subject to the volume ceiling\nrequire an allocation from the state's annual volume ceiling in order to\nqualify for federal tax exemption.\n\nIt is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to maximize the public\nbenefit through the issuance of private activity bonds for the purposes of,\namong other things, allocating a fair share of the bond volume ceiling upon\ninitial allocation and from a bond reserve to local agencies and for needs\nidentified by local governments; providing housing and promoting economic\ndevelopment; job creation; an economical energy supply; and resource recovery\nand to provide for an orderly and efficient volume ceiling allocation process\nfor state and local agencies by establishing an alternative formula for making\nsuch allocations.\n\nSection 3.

External pressures on\nfarm stability such as population growth ~~in non-metropolitan areas~~ ,\n_climate change,_ lack of access to affordable farmland, and public\ninfrastructure development pose a significant threat to farm operations, yet\nare the pressures over which farmers have the least control. Local initiatives\nin agricultural protection policy, facilitated by the agricultural districts\nprogram established in article twenty-five-AA of this chapter, have proved\neffective as a basic step in addressing these pressures. In an effort to\nencourage further development of agricultural and farmland protection\nprograms, and to recognize both the crucial role that local government plays\nin developing these strategies, plus the state constitutional directive to the\nlegislature to provide for the protection of agricultural lands, it is\ntherefore declared the policy of the state to promote local initiatives for\nagricultural and farmland protection.\n\nSection 2.

other law, any moneys provided to a public benefit corporation constituting a transportation authority or to other public transportation systems in payment of state operating assistance or such lesser

in full satisfaction, of any amounts which the authority would otherwise be entitled to receive under section 18-b of the transportation law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the reporting date provision of section 17-a of the transportation law, the reports of each regional transportation authority and other major public transportation systems receiving mass transportation operating assistance shall be submitted on or before July 15 of each year in the format prescribed by the commissioner of transportation. Copies of such reports shall also be filed with the chairpersons of the senate finance committee and the assembly ways and means committee and the director of the budget. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public transportation systems or private operators that do not provide such reports.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Payments may be made in quarterly installments as provided in subdivision 2 of section 18-b of the transportation law or in such other manner and at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the director of the budget, may provide; and where payment is not made in the manner provided by such subdivision 2, the matching payments required of any city, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company shall be made within 30 days of the payment of state operating assistance pursuant to this section or on such other basis as may be agreed upon by the commissioner of transportation, the director of the budget, and the chief executive officer of such city, county, Indian tribe or intercity bus company.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The commissioner of transportation shall be required to annually evaluate the operating and financial performance of each major public transportation system. Where the commissioner&#39;s evaluation process has identified a problem related to system performance, the commissioner may request the system to develop plans to address the performance deficiencies. The commissioner of transportation may withhold future state operating assistance payments to public transportation systems or private operators that do not provide such operating, financial, or other information as may be required by the commissioner to conduct the evaluation process.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Payments shall be made contingent upon compliance with regulations deemed necessary and appropriate, as prescribed by the commissioner of transportation and approved by the director of the budget, which shall promote the economy, efficiency, utility, effectiveness, and coordinated service delivery of public transportation systems. The chief executive officer of each public transportation system receiving a payment shall certify to the commissioner of transportation, in addition to information required by section 18-b of the transportation law, such other information as the commissioner of transportation shall determine is necessary to determine compliance and carry out the purposes herein.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Counties, municipalities or Indian tribes that propose to allocate service payments to operators on a basis other than the amount earned by the service payment formula shall be required to describe the proposed method of distributing governmental operating aid and submit it one month prior to the start of the operator&#39;s fiscal year to the commissioner of transportation in writing for review and approval prior to the distribution of state aid. The commissioner of transportation shall only approve alternate distribution methods which are consistent with the transportation needs of the people to be served and ensure that the system of private operators does not exceed established maximum service payment limits. Copies of such approvals shall be submitted to the chairpersons of the senate finance and assembly ways and means committees.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the transportation law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to continue to use prior quarter statistics to determine current quarter payment amounts, as initiated in the April to June quarter of 1981. In the event that actual revenue passengers and actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quarter, estimated statistics may be used as the basis of payment upon approval by the commissioner of transportation. In such event, the succeeding payment shall be adjusted to reflect the difference between the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle, nautical or car miles used as the basis of the estimated payment. The chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligible to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to operating expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless otherwise specified by such commissioner. In the event that a public transportation system ceases to participate in the program, operating assistance due for the final quarter that service is provided shall be based upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quarter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Payments shall be contingent on compliance with audit requirements determined by the commissioner of transportation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In the event that an audit of a public transportation system or private operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an overpayment of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an overpayment results from an audit of revenue passengers and the actual number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private operators in cases where more than a reasonable return based on equity or operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of transportation, in addition to recovering the amount of state operating assistance overpaid, shall also recover interest, as defined by the department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, whenever the commissioner of transportation is notified by the comptroller that the amount of revenues available for payment from an account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass transportation systems are eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for these purposes, the commissioner of transportation shall establish a maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set forth in appropriations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a of the state finance law and any other general or special law, payments may be made in quarterly installments or in such other manner and at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2.

In the event that actual revenue passengers and actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles are not available for the preceding quarter, estimated statistics may be used as the basis of payment upon approval by the commissioner of transportation. In such event, the succeeding payment shall be adjusted to reflect the difference between the actual and estimated total number of revenue passengers and vehicle, nautical or car miles used as the basis of the estimated payment. The chief executive officer may apply for less aid than the system is eligible to receive. Each quarterly payment shall be attributable to operating expenses incurred during the quarter in which it is received, unless otherwise specified by such commissioner. In the event that a public transportation system ceases to participate in the program, operating assistance due for the final quarter that service is provided shall be based upon the actual total number of revenue passengers and the actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car miles carried during that quarter.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Payments shall be contingent on compliance with audit requirements determined by the commissioner of transportation.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In the event that an audit of a public transportation system or private operator receiving funds discloses the existence of an overpayment of state operating assistance, regardless of whether such an overpayment results from an audit of revenue passengers and the actual number of revenue vehicle miles statistics, or an audit of private operators in cases where more than a reasonable return based on equity or operating revenues and expenses has resulted, the commissioner of transportation, in addition to recovering the amount of state operating assistance overpaid, shall also recover interest, as defined by the department of taxation and finance, on the amount of the overpayment.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other law, rule or regulation to the contrary, whenever the commissioner of transportation is notified by the comptroller that the amount of revenues available for payment from an account is less than the total amount of money for which the public mass transportation systems are eligible pursuant to the provisions of section 88-a of the state finance law and any appropriations enacted for these purposes, the commissioner of transportation shall establish a maximum payment limit which is proportionally lower than the amounts set forth in appropriations.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) of subdivisions 5 and 7 of section 88-a of the state finance law and any other general or special law, payments may be made in quarterly installments or in such other manner and at such other times as the commissioner of transportation, with the approval of the director of the budget may prescribe.</p>\n   </div>\n   <effective_clause>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 2.

Copies of such approvals shall be\nsubmitted to the chairpersons of the senate finance and assembly ways and\nmeans committees.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of subdivision 4 of section 18-b of the\ntransportation law, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to\ncontinue to use prior quarter statistics to determine current quarter payment\namounts, as initiated in the April to June quarter of 1981. In the event that\nactual revenue passengers and actual total number of vehicle, nautical or car\nmiles are not available for the preceding quarter, estimated statistics may be\nused as the basis of payment upon approval by the commissioner of\ntransportation. In such event, the succeeding payment shall be adjusted to\nreflect the difference between the actual and estimated total number of\nrevenue passengers and vehicle, nautical or car miles used as the basis of the\nestimated payment.
