reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Notwithstanding subsection (b), an insurer may rescind the exemption no less than 90 days after the exemption takes effect if the insurer or utilization review organization detects an increase in claims for payment or reimbursement for the health care service for which the exemption is granted that is disproportionate or anomalous to the health care

Reconsideration of a decision to decline renewal which involves the issue of medical necessity shall be performed on behalf of the insurer by a physician who meets the requirements of Section 27-3B-6(b).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) A decision by a health insurer on reconsideration, affirming or denying its rescission or nonrenewal, is final.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) All information, including, but not limited to, oral or written communications, clinical records, supporting documentation, up to the reason for rescinding or declining to renew an exemption, or any decision on a request for reconsideration, shall be held in the strictest confidence by both the insurer and the health care professional, subject to any of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">a. Reporting by an insurer of the facts of a case described in subdivision (c)(1) to the commissioner, an occupational licensing board, or law enforcement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">b. Disclosure to a third party by mutual, written agreement of the insurer and the health care professional, subject to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1320d et seq.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">c. Use by the insurer or health care provider as necessary to invoke or enforce any provision under a network provider contract.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) A health care professional who has been granted an exemption from prior authorization for a health care service which has been rescinded or not renewed, and who is otherwise a network provider, remains automatically eligible to receive an exemption for a subsequent year for any health care service he or she provides which may qualify for exemption, unless an exemption was rescinded in a case described in subdivision (c)(1).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) An exemption from prior authorization under this section shall not apply to any health care service that is deemed by the health care insurer to be experimental.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&sect;27-3B-9</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This chapter is intended to be construed in pari materia with Chapter 3A, the Health Care Service Utilization Review Act providing for the registration and regulation of utilization review agents by the Alabama Department of Public Health. Where a provision of this chapter conflicts with Chapter 3A, the provision of this chapter shall be given effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&sect;27-3B-10</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The commissioner may adopt any rules necessary to implement and enforce this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2.
