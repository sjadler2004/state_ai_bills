It increases certain filing fees throughout the Code and provides that, after 2025, these fees must automatically be adjusted for inflation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. It requires any party that files a petition, motion or other document with a probate court that is created with the assistance of artificial intelligence technology to verify the accuracy of the petition, motion or other document by affidavit and authorizes the court to impose appropriate sanctions on parties that violate this requirement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. It requires a personal representative who has mailed an inventory of the property of the decedent to all interested parties who requested the inventory to also file the inventory with the court. Under current law, the personal representative has discretion to file the inventory with the court in these circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">4. It provides that, like a guardian ad litem appointed by a probate court, a visitor appointed by a probate court is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity for acts performed within the scope of the visitor&#39;s duties.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">5. It changes from 14 years of age or older to 12 years of age or older the age at which an adoptee must consent either to a parent&#39;s consent to have the child adopted by a specific petitioner or to a parent&#39;s surrender and release of the parent&#39;s parental rights in favor of a licensed child-placing agency or the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

It requires any party that files a petition, motion or other document with\na probate court that is created with the assistance of artificial intelligence\ntechnology to verify the accuracy of the petition, motion or other document by\naffidavit and authorizes the court to impose appropriate sanctions on parties\nthat violate this requirement.\n\n3\\. It requires a personal representative who has mailed an inventory of the\nproperty of the decedent to all interested parties who requested the inventory\nto also file the inventory with the court. Under current law, the personal\nrepresentative has discretion to file the inventory with the court in these\ncircumstances.\n\n4\\. It provides that, like a guardian ad litem appointed by a probate court, a\nvisitor appointed by a probate court is entitled to quasi-judicial immunity\nfor acts performed within the scope of the visitor's duties.\n\n5\\. It changes from 14 years of age or older to 12 years of age or older the\nage at which an adoptee must consent either to a parent's consent to have the\nchild adopted by a specific petitioner or to a parent's surrender and release\nof the parent's parental rights in favor of a licensed child-placing agency or\nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
