The bill defines \"generative artificial intelligence\" as an\nartificial intelligence that is capable of generating text, images, videos, or\nother data in response to prompts. Under this bill, OIT is required to\nannually subject the New Jersey generative artificial intelligence program to\na safety test that includes, at minimum: (1) an analysis of potential\ncybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities; and (2) descriptions of possible\nremedies or defensive measures that can be taken by OIT to address all\npotential cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities during the conducting of\nthe safety test. The bill requires OIT to implement appropriate remedies and\ndefensive measures identified during the safety test.\n\nThe bill also requires that the education courses teach residents about\nartificial intelligence and \"natural language processing,\" which is the use of\nartificial intelligence to enable computers to interpret and comprehend human\nlanguage. The courses are to include, at a minimum, education on: (1) what\nartificial intelligence is and how generative artificial intelligence is\ndifferent from other artificial intelligence technologies; and (2) methods for\nidentifying and mitigating potential output inaccuracies, fabricated text, and\nbiases of generative artificial intelligence while respecting the privacy of\nthe public and complying with all applicable State and federal laws and\npolicies.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
