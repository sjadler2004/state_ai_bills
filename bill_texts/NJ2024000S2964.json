The bill does not require an employer to use an AEDT in\nmaking an employment decision, but it does require that an employer utilize an\nindependent bias auditing system of its AEDT if the employer elects to use an\nAEDT.\n\nThe bill defines \"automated employment decision tool,\" or \"AEDT\" to mean any\nsystem the function of which is governed by statistical theory, or systems the\nparameters of which are defined by systems, including inferential\nmethodologies, linear regression, neural networks, decision trees, random\nforests, and other learning algorithms, which automatically filter candidates\nor prospective candidates for hire or for any term, condition, or privilege of\nemployment in a way that establishes a preferred candidate or candidates.\n\nThe bill defines \"bias audit\" to mean an impartial evaluation, including but\nnot limited to testing, of an automated employment decision tool to assess its\npredicted compliance with the provisions of the \"Law Against Discrimination,\"\nand any other applicable law relating to discrimination in employment.\n\nThe bill requires employers to post the result of bias audits on employer\nwebsites, and it requires employers to provide notice to employment candidates\nor applicants of the use of an AEDT in employment decisions.\n\nThis bill is modeled after regulations in the New York City Administrative\nCode addressing the use of AEDTs and bias auditing of those systems.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
