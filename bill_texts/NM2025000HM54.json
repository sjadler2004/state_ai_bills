The platform allows students and staff to anonymously report safety, misconduct or other concerns through a mobile app, web interface or hotline; thirty-six school districts and eleven charter and community schools have been on-boarded, providing more than one thousand students access to the services; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, in a recent study report, <i>The Middle Matters: HM4 Middle School Study,</i> released October 16, 2024 by the legislative education study committee, in which the committee studied the quality of New Mexico middle school education, it was noted that students overwhelmingly reported school safety as their major concern; in fact, school safety became the one consensus item across the entire group of students for its importance to them, with students expressing fears about &quot;something bad happening&quot;; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, in 2024, the legislative education study committee published <i>Fostering Comprehensive School Safety</i>, which reports that efforts to assess the security needs of schools in New Mexico have revealed an ongoing and critical demand for security funding and identified a need for high-tech solutions like smart cameras or facial recognition software, while many schools report a pressing need for simpler, foundational items like security fencing and reliable radio communication devices; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the New Mexico legislature passed House Bill 505 in the 2023 legislative session, allocating thirty-five million dollars ($35,000,000) from the public school capital outlay fund to support security infrastructure in public schools, and schools have used the funds for a range of security items, including access control systems, consultation services, fencing, security lighting and even gunshot detection technology; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, although the allocation offered significant assistance to schools, the need for additional funding remains, as the 2023 allocation has been completely distributed, and based on recommendations from the staff who administered the allocated funds, an allocation of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) would meet ongoing demand for flexible security funding; further, based on an analysis and interactions with school leaders, legislative education study committee staff anticipate a need for sustained support into the foreseeable future; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, funding for varying security measures at separate and distinct schools alone may not be the tool needed to ensure safety in New Mexico&#39;s public schools statewide; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, some states have taken a broader statewide approach to addressing school safety; for example, the Indiana executive council on cybersecurity, along with the Indiana department of education and federal partners, developed an updated toolkit designed for superintendents, administrators, teachers, staff members, school board members, parents and concerned citizens that provides ways to protect schools, teachers, families, students and others; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, according to the October 5, 2022 report <i>50-State Comparison</i>, published by the education commission of the states regarding K-12 schools, at least thirty-two states have established a school safety entity, including centers, boards or offices, and at least forty-four states require a school safety plan in statute and regulations, with thirty of those states requiring law enforcement to be involved in the creation of a school safety plan; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, in 2023, Colorado established, similar to the state of Indiana, an office of school safety within Colorado&#39;s department of public safety composed of three units: the school safety resource center, the crisis unit and the grants unit; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, in lieu of funds spent for piecemeal improvements to New Mexico school safety, perhaps a more comprehensive approach could be employed in a standardized manner to more efficiently expend funds, prevent overlap and build statewide consistency in school safety measures; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, as such, a deeper dive into the subject matter, with a focus on a statewide positive impact, could reveal a benefit for New Mexico schools from a centralized, cohesive and standardized approach to school safety emanating from a specific entity tasked with developing and establishing the state&#39;s plan and distribution of resources for school safety;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO that the legislative education study committee, in collaboration with the department of public safety, the homeland security and emergency management department and the public education department, be requested to research and study school safety through a lens of establishing a designated entity, including a department, division or bureau, to develop, establish and maintain a statewide public school safety plan, including the creation by the entity of a website dedicated to providing information about the entity&#39;s role and the resources available and developed by the entity, the details of the public school safety plan and any other matter deemed appropriate and necessary to carry out the entity&#39;s mission and to report the results of the research and study to the governor and the New Mexico legislative council;
