Additional\nsix-month extensions shall be provided to policyholders for good cause._\n\n_(c) No policy that provides coverage for additional living expenses shall\nlimit the policyholder 's right to recovery if the insured home is rendered\nuninhabitable by a covered peril.

The additional living expense coverage pursuant to this section\nshall not apply to any utility's public safety power shutdown event involving\nthe deenergization of a portion of the electrical distribution or transmission\nsystem to reduce the risk of wildfire ignition._\n\n_(d) For a loss that is otherwise not subject to subsections (b) or (c), in\nthe event of a state of emergency declared pursuant to section 127A-14 that is\nrelated to a covered peril and accompanied by an order of civil authority\nrestricting access to the applicable home, additional living expenses coverage\nshall be provided for at least two weeks.

Statutory material to be repealed is bracketed and stricken. New\nstatutory material is underscored.\n\nSECTION 7.
