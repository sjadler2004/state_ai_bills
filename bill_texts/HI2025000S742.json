The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability crisis, which is pushing more young adults and families out of the State. The United States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, Oahu alone experienced a net loss of 31,682 residents due to domestic migration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the State with the highest cost of living in the nation and a tight and limited housing market, residents often struggle to get by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of residents are unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a sustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii&#39;s college graduates are underemployed five years after completing college.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better access, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address the affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed their data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance, bringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems, saving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their needs. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to translate data between state departments and convenes partners and stakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational elements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required to share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating agency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around operations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This leaves limits to the analyses available to decision makers that could be improved through streamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is currently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii&#39;s workforce if they attended college out of state or at a private college, joined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means that the State is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they enter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this gap in knowledge highlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways at the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage and afford to live in the State. With a centralized agency to help match graduate records between the department of education and the department of labor and industrial relations these kinds of gaps could be directly addressed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds that establishing a permanent data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services is an important step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful collaboration by state agencies and stakeholders.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services and coordinated by the chief data officer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2. Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part VII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;<b>\n     <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;

This means that the State is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they enter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this knowledge gap highlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways at the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage in the State.

The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability\ncrisis, which is pushing more young adults and families out of the State. The\nUnited States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, the State experienced\nan average net loss of 8,429 residents a year due to migration, continuing a\ntrend of population decline. As the State with the highest cost of living in\nthe nation and a tight and limited housing market, residents often struggle to\nget by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of residents are\nunable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a sustainable\nwage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii's college graduates are underemployed\nfive years after graduation.\n\nThe legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better\naccess, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address\nthe affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed\ntheir data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance,\nbringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems,\nsaving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their\nneeds. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to\ntranslate data between state departments and convenes partners and\nstakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.\n\nThe legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational\nelements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the\nHawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required\nto share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating\nagency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around\noperations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This limits the\nanalyses available to decision makers that could be improved through\nstreamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is\ncurrently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii's\nworkforce if they attended college out of state or at a private college,\njoined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means that the\nState is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they\nenter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this knowledge gap\nhighlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways\nat the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage in the State.\nWith a centralized agency to help match graduate records between the\ndepartment of education and the department of labor and industrial relations\nthese information gaps could be directly addressed.\n\nThe legislature also finds that establishing a permanent data sharing and\ngovernance working group within the office of enterprise technology services\nis an important step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful\ncollaboration by state agencies and stakeholders.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and\ngovernance working group within the office of enterprise technology services\nand coordinated by the chief data officer.\n\nSECTION 2.

The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability\ncrisis, which is pushing more young adults and families to relocate out of\nState. The United States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, the State\nexperienced an average net loss of 8,429 residents per year due to out-\nmigration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the State with the\nhighest cost of living in the nation and a tight and limited housing market,\nresidents often struggle to get by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per\ncent of residents are unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that\npay a sustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii's college graduates\nare underemployed five years after graduation.\n\nThe legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better\naccess, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address\nthe affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed\ntheir data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance,\nbringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems,\nsaving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their\nneeds. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to\ntranslate data between state departments and convenes partners and\nstakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.\n\nThe legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational\nelements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the\nHawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required\nto share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating\nagency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around\noperations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This limits the\nanalyses available to decision makers that could be improved through\nstreamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is\ncurrently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii's\nworkforce if they attended college out of state or at a private college,\njoined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means that the\nState is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they\nenter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this knowledge gap\nhighlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways\nat the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage in the State.\nWith a centralized agency to help match graduate records between the\ndepartment of education and the department of labor and industrial relations\nthese information gaps could be directly addressed.\n\nThe legislature also finds that establishing a data sharing and governance\nworking group within the office of enterprise technology services is an\nimportant step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful\ncollaboration by state agencies and stakeholders.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and\ngovernance working group within the office of enterprise technology services\nand coordinated by the chief data officer.\n\nSECTION 2. (a) There is established within the office of enterprise technology\nservices a data sharing and governance working group.\n\n(b) The data sharing and governance working group shall:\n\n(1) Review the adequacy of the departmental data sharing pursuant to section\n27-7, Hawaii Revised Statutes, and the data task force pursuant to section\n27-44, Hawaii Revised Statutes, in addressing the State's capabilities with\nregard to data sharing, with focus areas including:\n\n(A) The ability of the data exchange partnership to address gaps in data\ncollection, including high school to workforce data, federal employment data,\nand self-employment data;\n\n(B) Existing barriers to seamless and frequent cross-departmental data\nsharing;\n\n(C) Alignment between existing data-sharing efforts and relevant strategic\nplans from state and county governments, including the public education\nsystem, university of Hawaii, and workforce development council;\n\n(D) The ability for unemployment compensation wage record systems to include\noccupation, pay rate, and work location;\n\n(E) Gaps in resources and personnel to effectively collect, share, analyze,\nand disseminate findings from data; and\n\n(F) Needs relating to technology upgrades, data interoperability, and\nmodernization initiatives; and\n\n(2) Recommend an ongoing data-sharing governance structure that:\n\n(A) Identifies a centralized coordinating agency to ensure effective cross-\nagency direction, collaboration, and accountability;\n\n(B) Establishes formal governance structures and timelines for interagency\ncollaboration and data-sharing protocols;\n\n(C) Provides a unified, consistent source of information or analysis for\npolicy development and implementation;\n\n(D) Develops a framework to guide current management and future improvements;\n\n(E) Details a process for developing and prioritizing research questions\ntransparently and inclusively;\n\n(F) Details a process for disseminating actionable insights to a broader range\nof stakeholders, including philanthropic organizations and public-private\npartnerships;\n\n(G) Identifies opportunities to enhance the relevance and usability of system\noutputs for stakeholders, including policymakers and the public;\n\n(H) Supports the creation of public-facing, accessible dashboards;\n\n(I) Develops guidelines for stakeholders related to the use of artificial\nintelligence;

The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability\ncrisis, which is pushing more young adults and families to relocate out of\nState. The United States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, the State\nexperienced an average net loss of 8,429 residents per year due to out-\nmigration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the State with the\nhighest cost of living in the nation and a limited housing market, residents\noften struggle to get by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of\nresidents are unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a\nsustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii's college graduates are\nunderemployed five years after graduation.\n\nThe legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better\naccess, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address\nthe affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed\ntheir data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance,\nbringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems,\nsaving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their\nneeds. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to\ntranslate data between state departments and convenes partners and\nstakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.\n\nThe legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational\nelements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the\nHawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required\nto share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating\nagency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around\noperations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This limits the\nanalyses available to decision makers that could be improved through\nstreamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is\ncurrently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii's\nworkforce and whether they attended college out of state or at a private\ncollege, joined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means\nthat the State is unable to account for a significant number of young adults\nas they enter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this\nknowledge gap highlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in\ncareer pathways at the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living\nwage in the State. With a centralized agency to help match graduate records\nbetween the department of education and the department of labor and industrial\nrelations, these information gaps could be directly addressed.\n\nThe legislature also finds that establishing a data sharing and governance\nworking group within the office of enterprise technology services is an\nimportant step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful\ncollaboration by state agencies and stakeholders.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and\ngovernance working group within the office of enterprise technology services\nand coordinated by the chief data officer.\n\nSECTION 2. (a) There is established within the office of enterprise technology\nservices a data sharing and governance working group.\n\n(b) The data sharing and governance working group shall:\n\n(1) Review the adequacy of departmental data sharing pursuant to section 27-7,\nHawaii Revised Statutes, and the data task force pursuant to section 27-44,\nHawaii Revised Statutes, in addressing the State's data sharing needs, with\nfocus areas including:\n\n(A) The ability of the data exchange partnership to address gaps in data\ncollection, including high school to workforce data, federal employment data,\nand self-employment data;\n\n(B) Existing barriers to seamless and frequent cross-departmental data\nsharing;\n\n(C) Alignment between existing data-sharing efforts and relevant strategic\nplans from state and county governments, including the public education\nsystem, university of Hawaii, and workforce development council;\n\n(D) The ability for unemployment compensation wage record systems to include\noccupation, pay rate, and work location;\n\n(E) Gaps in resources and personnel to effectively collect, share, analyze,\nand disseminate findings from data; and\n\n(F) Needs relating to technology upgrades, data interoperability, and\nmodernization initiatives; and\n\n(2) Recommend an ongoing data-sharing governance structure that:\n\n(A) Identifies a centralized coordinating agency to ensure effective cross-\nagency direction, collaboration, and accountability;\n\n(B) Establishes formal governance structures and timelines for interagency\ncollaboration and data-sharing protocols;\n\n(C) Provides a unified, consistent source of information or analysis for\npolicy development and implementation;\n\n(D) Develops a framework to guide current management and future improvements;\n\n(E) Details a process for developing and prioritizing research questions\ntransparently and inclusively;\n\n(F) Details a process for disseminating actionable insights to a broader range\nof stakeholders, including philanthropic organizations and public-private\npartnerships;\n\n(G) Identifies opportunities to enhance the relevance and usability of system\noutputs for stakeholders, including policymakers and the public;\n\n(H) Supports the creation of public-facing, accessible dashboards;\n\n(I) Develops guidelines for stakeholders related to the use of artificial\nintelligence;

and\n\n(16) Two members representing for-profit business organizations having\nexperience in data sharing and governance, of which one member shall be chosen\nand invited by the speaker of the house of representatives and one member\nshall be chosen and invited by the president of the senate.\n\n(d) The data sharing and governance working group shall select members for and\nconvene one or more advisory groups to solicit input from a diverse range of\nstakeholders, including:\n\n(1) Students and parents;\n\n(2) Labor and workforce organizations;\n\n(3) Business and industry representatives;\n\n(4) Equity and social justice organizations;\n\n(5) Researchers and privacy experts; and\n\n(6) Early education experts, school districts, and charter schools.\n\n(e) The office of enterprise technology services may contract with an\nadministrative facilitator to provide necessary support for the data sharing\nand governance working group in carrying out its duties.\n\n(f) The members of the working group shall serve without compensation, but\nshall be entitled to reimbursement for expenses, including travel expenses,\nnecessary for the performance of their duties.\n\n(g) The data sharing and governance working group shall submit a report of its\nfindings and recommendations, including any proposed legislation, to the\nlegislature no later than twenty days prior to the convening of the regular\nsession of 2026.\n\n(h) The data sharing and governance working group shall cease to exist on June\n30, 2026.\n\nSECTION 3. There is appropriated out of the general revenues of the State of\nHawaii the sum of $ or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal year\n2025-2026 and the same sum or so much thereof as may be necessary for fiscal\nyear 2026-2027 for the data sharing and governance working group.\n\nThe sums appropriated shall be expended by the office of enterprise technology\nservices for the purposes of this Act.\n\nSECTION 4.

The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability crisis, which is pushing more young adults and families to relocate out of State. The United States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, the State experienced an average net loss of 8,429 residents per year due to out-migration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the State with the highest cost of living in the nation and a limited housing market, residents often struggle to get by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of residents are unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a sustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii&#39;s college graduates are underemployed five years after graduation.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better access, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address the affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed their data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance, bringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems, saving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their needs. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to translate data between state departments and convenes partners and stakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational elements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required to share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating agency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around operations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This limits the analyses available to decision makers that could be improved through streamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is currently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii&#39;s workforce if they attended college out of state or at a private college, joined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means that the State is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they enter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this knowledge gap highlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways at the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage in the State. With a centralized agency to help match graduate records between the department of education and the department of labor and industrial relations, these information gaps could be directly addressed.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds that establishing a data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services is an important step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful collaboration among state agencies and stakeholders.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services to be chaired by the chief information officer.</p>\n   </div>\n   <a name=\"section-Act 154, Section 2-new\"></a><div title=\"Section: Act 154, Section 2, Action: &quot;new&quot;\" class=\"sectionContent\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2.
