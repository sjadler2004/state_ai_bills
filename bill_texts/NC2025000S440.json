The match requirement may be satisfied by non-State expenditures for public school facilities made on or after January 1, 2021. If a debt has been incurred since January 1, 2021, for the general purpose of public school facilities, then the face amount of the debt shall be considered as a non-State expenditure for public school facilities for the purpose of the match. No other expenditures made or debts incurred before January 1, 2022, may be used to satisfy the match requirement.

These reports shall include any information and documentation required by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall certify to the State Treasurer from time to time the extent to which the match requirements of this subsection have been met with respect to each county.

The State Board of Education shall also require counties to report annually on the impact of funds provided under this act on the property tax rate for that year.

The match requirement may be satisfied by non-State expenditures for public school facilities made on or after January 1, 2021. If a debt has been incurred since January 1, 2021, for the general purpose of public school facilities, then the face amount of the debt shall be considered as a non-State expenditure for public school facilities for the purpose of the match. No other expenditures made or debts incurred before January 1, 2022, may be used to satisfy the match requirement.

These reports shall include any information and documentation required by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall certify to the State Treasurer from time to time the extent to which the match requirements of this subsection have been met with respect to each county.

The State Board of Education shall also require counties to report annually on the impact of funds provided under this act on the property tax rate for that year.
