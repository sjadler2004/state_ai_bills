The Legislature finds and declares that data center operation is one of the fastest growing industries worldwide and in the United States and that as of March 2024, there are 5,381 data centers located in the United States, 73 of which are located in New Jersey.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that data center load growth has tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple by 2028.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that PJM Interconnection (PJM) is the regional transmission organization that manages the electric grid across 13 states, including New Jersey; that PJM&#39;s capacity market ensures long-term grid reliability by securing the appropriate amount of power supply resources required to meet predicted energy demand; and that PJM utilizes an annual capacity auction to procure capacity for a given year.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that at PJM&#39;s capacity auction in July 2024 capacity prices increased by $12.5 billion compared to capacity prices from the previous year; and that the 2025 Basic Generation Service auction for residential and small commercial customers (BGS-RSCP), certified by the Board of Public Utilities, saw approximately 35 percent higher prices than in 2023.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that in both auctions increased capacity prices were driven by an expected increase in demand and a stagnant supply of energy in New Jersey and the rest of the PJM territory.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that many states served by PJM, including New Jersey, urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to safeguard ratepayers from unwarranted prices by modifying PJM&#39;s auction price cap due to growing concerns about the potential for excessive capacity market price increases in upcoming capacity auctions, which prompted the FERC to postpone the PJM&#39;s next capacity auction.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature further finds and declares that the expansion of data centers has placed strain on the electric grid and that projections of increased energy demand from data centers has put an undue burden on New Jersey ratepayers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The Legislature therefore determines that it is in the public interest of the residents of New Jersey to require all electricity supplied to a data center within the State to be derived from new verifiable Class I renewable energy, energy from nuclear power plants, or a combination thereof.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> 2. As used in this act:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;AI data center&quot; means the same as defined in section 2 of P.L.2024, c.49 (C.34:1B-395).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Application for local development approval&quot; means the application form and all accompanying documents required for approval of a subdivision plat, site plan, planned development, conditional use, zoning variance, or direction of the issuance of a permit pursuant to the &quot;Municipal Land Use Law,&quot; P.L.1975, c.291 (C.40:55D-1 et seq.) or R.S.40:27-1 et seq., for any use, development, or construction.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Artificial intelligence&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; means the same as defined in section 2 of P.L.2024, c.49 (C.34:1B-395).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Board&quot; means the Board of Public Utilities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Class I renewable energy&quot; means the same as defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Nuclear power plant&quot; means the same as defined in section 2 of P.L.2018, c.16 (C.48:3-87.4).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Person&quot; means the same as defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.&quot; or &quot;PJM&quot; means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51). </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> &quot;Transmission and distribution system&quot; means the same as the term is defined in section 3 of P.L.1999, c.23 (C.48:3-51).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> 3. a.
