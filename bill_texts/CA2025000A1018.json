Automated decision systems.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The California Fair Employment and Housing Act establishes the Civil Rights Department within the Business, Consumer Services, and Housing Agency and requires the department to, among other things, bring civil actions to enforce the act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires, on or before September 1, 2024, the Department of Technology to conduct, in coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, a comprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated decision systems that have been proposed for use, development, or procurement by, or are being used, developed, or procured by, any state agency.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would generally regulate the development and deployment of an automated decision system (ADS) used to make consequential decisions, as defined. The bill would define &quot;automated decision system&quot; to mean a computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to assist or replace human discretionary decisionmaking and materially impacts natural persons.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require a developer of a covered ADS, as defined, to take certain actions, including conduct performance evaluations of the covered ADS and provide deployers to whom the developer transfers the covered ADS with certain information, including the results of those performance evaluations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would, beginning January 1, 2027, require a deployer of a covered ADS to take certain actions, including provide certain disclosures to a subject of a consequential decision made or facilitated by the covered ADS, provide the subject an opportunity to opt out of the use of the covered ADS, provide the subject with an opportunity to appeal the outcome of the consequential decision, and submit the covered ADS to third-party audits, as prescribed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would prescribe requirements for a third party to audit a covered ADS, as prescribed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require a developer, deployer, or auditor to, within 30 days of receiving a request from the Attorney General, provide an unredacted copy of the performance evaluation or disparate impact assessment prepared pursuant to the bill to the Attorney General and would exempt those records from the California Public Records Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would authorize certain public entities, including the Attorney General, to bring a specified civil action for noncompliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Article 3 (commencing with Section 12959) is added to Chapter 6 of\nPart 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, to read:\n\n3\\. Automated Decision Systems\n\n12959\\. In an action alleging a violation of this chapter in which an\nautomated decision system, as defined in Section 22756 of the Business and\nProfessions Code, is alleged to have committed or facilitated the violation,\nthe extent to which the defendant complied with Chapter 24.6 (commencing with\nSection 22756) of Division 8 of the Business and Professions Code is relevant\nto, but not conclusive of, whether a defendant violated this chapter.\n\nSEC. 4. The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which\nadds Chapter 24.6 (commencing with Section 22756) to Division 8 of the\nBusiness and Professions Code, imposes a limitation on the public's right of\naccess to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials\nand agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California\nConstitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes\nthe following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this\nlimitation and the need for protecting that interest:\n\nIn order to protect proprietary information, it is necessary that trade\nsecrets disclosed in performance evaluations and impact assessments to\nagencies and departments pursuant to Section 1 of this act remain\nconfidential.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

The bill would define \"automated decision system\" to mean a\ncomputational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling,\ndata analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output,\nincluding a score, classification, or recommendation, that is _designed or_\nused to assist or replace human discretionary decisionmaking and materially\nimpacts natural persons.\n\nThis bill would require a developer of a covered ADS, as defined, to take\ncertain actions, including conduct performance evaluations of the covered ADS\nand provide deployers to whom the developer transfers the covered ADS with\ncertain information, including the results of those performance evaluations.\n\nThis bill would, beginning January 1, 2027, require a deployer of a covered\nADS to take certain actions, including provide certain disclosures to a\nsubject of a consequential decision made or facilitated by the covered ADS,\nprovide the subject an opportunity to opt out of the use of the covered ADS,\nprovide the subject with an opportunity to appeal the outcome of the\nconsequential decision, and submit the covered ADS to third-party audits, as\nprescribed._The bill would also prescribe requirements for a third party to\naudit a covered ADS._\n\n~~This bill would prescribe requirements for a third party to audit a covered\nADS, as prescribed.~~\n\nThis bill would require a developer, deployer, or auditor to, within 30 days\nof receiving a request from the Attorney General, provide an unredacted copy\nof the performance evaluation or disparate impact assessment prepared pursuant\nto the bill to the Attorney General and would exempt those records from the\nCalifornia Public Records Act.\n\nThis bill would authorize certain public entities, including the Attorney\nGeneral, to bring a specified civil action for noncompliance.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the\nright of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public\nofficials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest\nprotected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.
