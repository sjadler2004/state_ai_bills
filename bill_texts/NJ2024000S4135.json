The bill also provides that an institutional project is eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, which incentive award is limited to a maximum value of $120 million.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> To qualify for an incentive award under the Aspire Program, the bill provides that the developer of an institutional project is required to contribute capital of at least $30 million, regardless of the overall cost of the project, except when the project is located in a government-restricted municipality. Under current law, the developer of a redevelopment project is required to contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project costs, except that if the project is located in a government-restricted municipality, the developer is required to contribute capital of at least 10 percent of the total project cost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Additionally, the bill provides that an institutional project is not subject to a net benefit analysis that is required for certain other redevelopment projects. Under current law, an exemption from the net benefit analysis is provided for investments in residential projects, food delivery sources, and health care or health services centers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill also provides similar changes for institutional projects that qualify as transformative projects under the Aspire Program. Specifically, the bill provides that these projects are eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, up to $400 million or the amount of the project financing gap. The bill also exempts these projects from the net benefit analysis requirement.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

The authority may also contract with an\nindependent third party to perform a background check on the developer.\n\ng. Notwithstanding the limitation on incentive awards set forth in subsection\nb. of section 61 and section 98 of P.L.2020, c.156 (C.34:1B-329 and\nC.34:1B-362) to the contrary, the authority may allow a developer of a\ntransformative project a tax credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of:\n\n(1) (a) 80 percent of the total project cost for a transformative project that\nis located in a government-restricted municipality _or an institutional\nproject_ ;\n\n(b) 60 percent of the total project cost for a residential transformative\nproject that receives a four-percent allocation from the federal Low Income\nHousing Tax Credit Program administered by the agency or a transformative\nproject that is located in a qualified incentive tract, enhanced area, or a\nmunicipality with a Municipal Revitalization Index score of at least 50; or\n\n(c) 50 percent of the total project cost for any other transformative project;\n\n(2) the total value of the project financing gap; or\n\n(3) $400,000,000, except that for a transformative project that is developed\nin phases, the $400,000,000 limitation on incentive awards set forth in this\nparagraph shall apply to the total aggregate award for all phases of the\ntransformative project.\n\n(cf: P.L.2023, c.98, s.9)\n\n6\\. This act shall take effect immediately.\n\nSTATEMENT\n\nThis bill modifies certain provisions of the \"New Jersey Aspire Program\"\n(Aspire Program) related to construction of institutional projects.\n\nUnder the bill, the term \"institutional project\" is defined as a redevelopment\nproject that is developed by, or in affiliation with, a public or private\ninstitution of higher education, and for which at least 51 percent of the\nsquare footage of the project is dedicated for the use of qualified research\nand development. \"Qualified research and development\" is defined to mean\nresearch and development activities that are undertaken within a priority\nindustry, including, but not limited to, technology, artificial intelligence,\nsoftware development, financial services, financial services technology, film\nand digital media, advanced manufacturing, gaming, pharmaceuticals,\nbiotechnology, transportation, logistics, and renewable energy.\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the calculation of the \"project cost\" of an\ninstitutional project to include the construction and completion of: research\nworkspaces; meeting, classroom, dining, and dormitory spaces; and common\nareas, including, but not limited to, hallways, utility rooms, storage areas,\nand parking components. The bill also provides that an institutional project\nis eligible for an incentive award equal to 80 percent of project costs, which\nincentive award is limited to a maximum value of $120 million.\n\nTo qualify for an incentive award under the Aspire Program, the bill provides\nthat the developer of an institutional project is required to contribute\ncapital of at least $30 million, regardless of the overall cost of the\nproject, except when the project is located in a government-restricted\nmunicipality. Under current law, the developer of a redevelopment project is\nrequired to contribute capital of at least 20 percent of the total project\ncosts, except that if the project is located in a government-restricted\nmunicipality, the developer is required to contribute capital of at least 10\npercent of the total project cost.\n\nAdditionally, the bill provides that an institutional project is not subject\nto a net benefit analysis that is required for certain other redevelopment\nprojects. Under current law, an exemption from the net benefit analysis is\nprovided for investments in residential projects, food delivery sources, and\nhealth care or health services centers.\n\nThe bill also provides similar changes for institutional projects that qualify\nas transformative projects under the Aspire Program. Specifically, the bill\nprovides that these projects are eligible for an incentive award equal to 80\npercent of project costs, up to $400 million or the amount of the project\nfinancing gap. The bill also exempts these projects from the net benefit\nanalysis requirement.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

The authority shall review the transformative project cost, evaluate and validate the project financing gap estimated by the developer, and conduct a State fiscal impact analysis to ensure that the overall public assistance provided to the transformative project will result in a net positive benefit to the State.

A developer shall pay to the authority the full amount of the direct costs of an analysis concerning the developer&#39;s application for an incentive award that a third party retained by the authority performs, if the authority deems such retention to be necessary. The authority shall evaluate the net economic benefits on a present value basis under which the requested tax credit allocation amount is discounted to present value at the same discount rate as the projected benefits from the implementation of the proposed transformative project for which an award of tax credits is being sought. Projects that are predominantly residential<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">, that are institutional projects,</u>or that qualify as special mission non-profit projects shall be excluded from the calculation of the net benefit test required pursuant to this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">d.
