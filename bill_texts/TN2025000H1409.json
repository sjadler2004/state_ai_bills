The funds so reduced shall be allocated to other categories with priority given to water/sewer projects.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Selection criteria for project approvals shall be uniform within categories, objective and quantitative, and shall be based on project need, project feasibility, project impact, community need, the percent of project beneficiaries that have family incomes below the low and moderate income (LMI) levels, and, for community livability projects, essentialness.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Project application materials will be supplemented, as appropriate, by site visits and by informed opinions of state agencies knowledgeable about particular projects.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The level of CDBG assistance for individual projects shall be determined by the following factors: (1) a maximum grant of $600,000 for individual projects ($400,000 for community livability projects); and (2) the grantee&#39;s ability to pay. A ThreeStar bonus that increases the grant amount by 5% is added to grantees in certified ThreeStar counties. Higher grant levels (up to $1,000,000) may be approved for regional projects.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">If modifications in the expenditure plan for the CDBG Program are required, said modifications shall be accomplished in the following manner: (1) If the General Assembly is in session, such modifications shall be approved by the General Assembly; or (2) if the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may either (a) submit such modifications to the State Funding Board for approval or (b) call a special session of the General Assembly for approval.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 32.

Said sum being the estimated allocation of funds for the fiscal years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 combined.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Provided, however, that all expenditures of any community development block grant funds in addition to those appropriated and enumerated in this section shall be subject to the following limitations and restrictions:</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The Housing and Community Development Act of 1981 made it possible for states to assume administration of the Small Cities Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) previously administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In Tennessee, the CDBG Program shall be administered by the Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD).</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">There shall be appropriated by the General Assembly to ECD such funds as may be allocated to Tennessee by the federal government for the CDBG Program. The state- administered CDBG Program shall be developed within the parameters of the CDBG legislation, applicable federal regulations, and consultation with citizens and elected officials in Tennessee.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The CDBG goals shall be three-fold: (1) target on areas of economic distress; (2) stimulate the growth of jobs and income in these areas; and (3) maximize the number of grantees. Additionally, all CDBG projects must meet one of the three national objectives of (1) principally benefiting persons of low and moderate income; (2) elimination or prevention of slums and blight; or (3) elimination of conditions detrimental to health, safety or public welfare. ECD shall be authorized to make grants and/or loans of CDBG monies to eligible city and county governments in Tennessee to achieve these goals. Loan payments and interest shall be reserved for reappropriation and shall not revert to the general fund balance at year end.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Eligible applicants shall be all city and county governments in Tennessee except those cities and counties designated by HUD as CDBG entitlement areas. Cities excluded from the state-administered CDBG Program include Memphis and Shelby County, Nashville (Davidson County), Chattanooga, Knoxville and Knox County, Clarksville, Bristol, Johnson City, Oak Ridge, Murfreesboro, Kingsport, Hendersonville, Morristown, Cleveland, Franklin, and Jackson.

The funds so reduced shall be allocated to other categories with priority given to water/sewer projects.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Selection criteria for project approvals shall be uniform within categories, objective and quantitative, and shall be based on project need, project feasibility, project impact, community need, the percent of project beneficiaries that have family incomes below the low and moderate income (LMI) levels, and, for community livability projects, essentialness.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Project application materials will be supplemented, as appropriate, by site visits and by informed opinions of state agencies knowledgeable about particular projects.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The level of CDBG assistance for individual projects shall be determined by the following factors: (1) a maximum grant of $ 600,000 for individual projects ($ 400,000 for community livability projects); and (2) the grantee&#39;s ability to pay. A ThreeStar bonus that increases the grant amount by 5% is added to grantees in certified ThreeStar counties. Higher grant levels (up to $ 1,000,000) may be approved for regional projects.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">If modifications in the expenditure plan for the CDBG Program are required, said modifications shall be accomplished in the following manner: (1) If the General Assembly is in session, such modifications shall be approved by the General Assembly; or (2) if the General Assembly is not in session, the Governor may either (a) submit such modifications to the State Funding Board for approval or (b) call a special session of the General Assembly for approval.</p>\n   </div>\n   <a name=\"section-Chapter 530, Section 32-new\"></a><div title=\"Section: Chapter 530, Section 32, Action: &quot;new&quot;\" class=\"sectionContent\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 32.
