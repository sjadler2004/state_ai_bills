[<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] IMPROPER DISSEMINATION OF COVERED SYNTHETIC CONTENT--CIVIL LIABILITY.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A private cause of action against a person for the nonconsensual dissemination of covered synthetic content exists when:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the person publicly disseminates covered synthetic content with:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) knowledge that a depicted person in the covered synthetic content did not consent to the dissemination; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the intent to harass, entrap, defame, extort or otherwise cause financial or reputational harm to the depicted person;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the covered synthetic content realistically represents a depicted person engaging in conduct that the depicted person did not actually engage in; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the depicted person is identifiable from:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) the covered synthetic content alone; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) other personal information displayed or disseminated in connection with the covered synthetic content.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The fact that a depicted person consents to the creation of covered synthetic content or to the nonpublic distribution of the covered synthetic content shall not constitute a defense to liability for a person who improperly disseminates the covered synthetic content as provided in Subsection A of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A person shall not be liable for improper dissemination of covered synthetic content as provided in Subsection A of this section if:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the dissemination is made:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) for the purpose of a criminal investigation or prosecution that is otherwise lawful;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) for the purpose of or in connection with a report of unlawful conduct to appropriate authorities; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) in the course of seeking or receiving medical or mental health treatment, and the covered synthetic content is protected from further dissemination by the recipient;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the person who disseminated the covered synthetic content commercially obtained the content for the purpose of the person&#39;s lawful sale of goods or services, including artistic creations, and the depicted person knew that the covered synthetic content would be created and disseminated commercially;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the covered synthetic content relates to a matter of public interest; the dissemination of the content serves a lawful public purpose; and the person that disseminates the content clearly identifies that the content is covered synthetic content;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the dissemination is for legitimate scientific research or educational purposes, the covered synthetic content is clearly identified as such and the person who disseminates the content acts in good faith to minimize the risk that the covered synthetic content will be further disseminated;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) the dissemination is made for use in legal proceedings and:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) is consistent with common practice in civil proceedings necessary for the proper functioning of the court system; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the content is protected by court order that prohibits any further dissemination; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) the dissemination constitutes criticism, comment, satire, parody, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research and a reasonable consumer receiving the content would not believe it to accurately represent the depicted person&#39;s speech or conduct.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. In a civil action filed pursuant to this section, the court may issue an order to protect the privacy of the plaintiff, including protection by:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) allowing the plaintiff to use a pseudonym in any documents filed in the action that will be publicly available;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) requiring the parties to the action to redact all of the plaintiff&#39;s personal identifying information from any documents filed in the action that will be publicly available or to file such documents under seal; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) issuing a protective order for purposes of discovery in the action, which may include an order indicating that any intimate visual depiction or digital forgery shall remain in the care, custody and control of the court.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. In an action filed pursuant to this section, a prevailing plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney fees and costs and:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) liquidated damages in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000); or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) actual damages sustained by the plaintiff.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 4. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] IMPROPER DISSEMINATION OF COVERED SYNTHETIC CONTENT--CRIMINAL LIABILITY.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. Improper dissemination of covered synthetic content consists of knowingly disseminating or presenting any likeness of an identifiable person in covered synthetic content with the purpose of harassing, entrapping, defaming, extorting or otherwise causing financial or reputational harm to the depicted person.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. A person who commits improper dissemination of covered synthetic content is guilty of a fourth degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the provisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The attorney general and the district attorney in the county with jurisdiction shall have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 5. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] IDENTIFICATION OF, LABELING AND CLASSIFYING SYNTHETIC CONTENT.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A provider shall place an imperceptible watermark that is designed to be as difficult to remove as is reasonably possible using state-of-the-art techniques into covered synthetic content that is produced or significantly modified by a generative artificial intelligence system that the provider makes available. A watermark shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) identify content as synthetic and identify the provider to ensure that if a sample of the content is corrupted, downscaled, cropped or otherwise damaged, the watermark information will remain; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) be compatible with widely used industry standards.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. If covered synthetic content is too small to directly contain the required provenance data that is part of a watermark, the provider shall, at a minimum, attempt to embed provenance data into the content that identifies the content as partially or entirely synthetic and communicates the following provenance data in order of priority:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the name of the provider;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the name and version number of the artificial intelligence system that generated the content; (3) the time and date the content was created; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) if applicable, the specific portions of the content that are synthetic.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A provider shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) make available, at no cost to the public, a watermark decoder that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) provides an easy and quick method for a user of the decoder to assess the provenance of a single piece of content; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) to the greatest extent possible, adheres to relevant national or international standards;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) before the release of any new generative artificial intelligence system, and annually thereafter, conduct artificial intelligence red-teaming involving third-party experts to test whether watermarks in the system can be easily removed from covered synthetic content produced by a provider&#39;s generative artificial intelligence system, as well as whether the provider&#39;s generative artificial intelligence systems can be used to falsely add watermarks to otherwise nonsynthetic content;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) if the provider allows its generative artificial intelligence system to be downloaded and modified, conduct additional artificial intelligence red-teaming to assess whether the provider&#39;s system&#39;s watermark functionalities can be disabled without authorization;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) make summaries of its artificial intelligence red-teaming exercises publicly available in electronic form and provide a clearly labeled link to the summaries on the provider&#39;s internet website home page. The link shall be similar in appearance and size relative to other links on the same web page. The provider shall remove from the summaries any details that pose an immediate risk to public safety or provide information that could be used to disable or circumvent the functionality of watermarks specified in the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) submit a full report of each artificial intelligence red-teaming exercise it conducts to the attorney general within six months of completion of the exercise;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) within ninety-six hours of discovering a material vulnerability or failure in a generative artificial intelligence system related to the erroneous or malicious inclusion or removal of provenance data or watermarks, report the vulnerability or failure to the attorney general; and:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) notify other providers that may be affected by similar vulnerabilities or failures in a manner that allows the other providers to protect their own artificial intelligence systems but does not compromise the reporting provider&#39;s systems or disclose the reporting provider&#39;s confidential or proprietary information; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to notify parties affected by the vulnerability or failure identified, including notification to online platforms, researchers or users who received incorrect results from a watermark decoder or users who produced covered synthetic content that contained incorrect or insufficient provenance data; provided, however, that a provider shall not be required to notify an affected party whose contact information the provider has not previously collected or retained; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) make any report to the attorney general required pursuant to this section publicly available by providing a clearly labeled link to the report on the provider&#39;s internet website home page. The link shall be similar in appearance and size relative to other links on the same web page; provided, however, that if public disclosure of the report could or does present public safety risks, a provider may instead:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) post a summary disclosure of the reported material vulnerability or failure; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) for no longer than thirty days, delay the public disclosure of the report until the public safety risks have been mitigated. If a provider delays public disclosure, the provider shall also document all efforts to resolve the material vulnerability or failure as quickly as possible.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A provider and any distributor of software or online services shall not make available to any person a system, application, tool or service that is designed to remove watermarks from covered synthetic content.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A large online platform shall use the provenance data of content and state-of-the-art techniques to classify content that is uploaded by users. If the large online platform is able to detect and interpret the provenance data of content, using that provenance data, the large online platform shall classify the content as &quot;fully synthetic&quot;, &quot;partially synthetic&quot;, &quot;nonsynthetic&quot; or &quot;nonsynthetic with minor modifications&quot;. If content uploaded to or distributed on a large online platform by a user does not contain provenance data, or if the provenance data cannot be interpreted or detected by the platform, the platform shall classify the content as &quot;content of unknown provenance&quot;.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. For content classified as content of unknown provenance according to Subsection E of this section, a large online platform shall further use state-of-the-art techniques to classify content as &quot;possibly covered synthetic content with unknown provenance&quot; or &quot;possibly nonsynthetic content of unknown provenance&quot;.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. A large online platform shall use labels to disclose the classification assigned to content in accordance with this section. The labels shall prominently display whether content was classified using provenance data or state-of-the-art techniques and which classification the content was assigned, as provided in Subsections E and F of this section. If content was classified according to provenance data, the platform shall ensure that a user is able to click or tap on a label to inspect provenance data, which shall be presented in a clear and simple format. If content was classified according to state-of-the-art techniques, the platform shall include an additional label that warns users that the technique may have incorrectly classified the content and discloses the approximate error rate of the technique used to classify the content.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H. Disclosures required pursuant to this section shall be readily legible to an average viewer or, if the disclosure is made in audio format, shall be clearly audible. A disclosure in audio form shall occur at the beginning and end of a piece of audio content and shall be presented in a prominent manner and at a comparable volume and speaking cadence as other spoken words in the content.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">I. A user of a large online platform shall have reasonable opportunity to appeal the classification of content by a large online platform.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 6. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] ENFORCEMENT.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The attorney general may enforce the provisions of the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act and may promulgate any rules necessary to implement and enforce the provisions of that act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Prior to filing a civil action to enforce the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act, the attorney general may issue a civil investigative demand based on a reasonable belief that a person may be in possession, custody or control of an original or copy of any book, record, report, memorandum, paper, communication, tabulation, map, chart, photograph, mechanical transcription or other document or recording relevant to the subject matter of an investigation of a probable violation of that act. A person issued an investigative demand shall produce the material sought and shall permit it to be copied and inspected. The demand of the attorney general and any material produced in response to it shall not be a matter of public record and shall not be published by the attorney general except by order of the court.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Upon reasonable belief that there has been a violation of the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act, the attorney general:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) may bring an action in the name of the state to enforce that act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) may petition the district court for injunctive relief;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) shall not be required to post bond when seeking a temporary or permanent injunction; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) may recover on behalf of the state a penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) and not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation of that act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 7. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] POSTING SYNTHETIC CONTENT--IDENTITY VERIFICATION REQUIRED.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A large online platform shall use a reasonable identity verification method to verify a platform user&#39;s identity before allowing the user to post content on the platform if the content:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) was classified by the platform as fully synthetic, partially synthetic or possibly covered synthetic content of unknown provenance as provided in the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) purports to depict reality.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The verification process provided for in Subsection A of this section shall be performed each time a platform user attempts to post content that meets the descriptions in Paragraph (1) or (2) of that subsection or if more than sixty minutes has elapsed since the previous verification was performed in connection with that user&#39;s content; provided, however, that verification shall not be required to be performed more frequently than every sixty minutes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A large online platform shall protect any information obtained while performing actions required pursuant to this section using, at a minimum, the industry standard to protect users&#39; most sensitive information, including medical or financial data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A large online platform shall not use identification information provided by a user or obtained by the platform in the process of actions required pursuant to this section for any purpose other than compliance with this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A large online platform shall disclose information obtained pursuant to actions performed pursuant to this section only as required by a court order. A court shall only issue an order for disclosure of such information in a civil case if:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the plaintiff in the case undertakes efforts to notify the person that posted the content and whose information was obtained through a verification process pursuant to this section that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an order of disclosure, and the person has had a reasonable opportunity to oppose the subpoena or application;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the plaintiff identifies and sets forth the exact statements or provides information sufficient to identify the content about which the case was filed;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case against the person that posted the content and whose information was obtained through a verification process pursuant to this section by producing evidence for each element of the cause of action; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the court determines that the rights of the person that posted the content and whose information was obtained through a verification process pursuant to this section under the first amendment to the United States constitution are outweighed by the strength of the prima facie case presented by the plaintiff and the necessity for the disclosure of the person&#39;s identity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. A large online platform shall disclose information obtained through actions performed pursuant to this section only as required by a court order. A court shall only issue an order for disclosure of such information in a criminal case if the attorney general:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) has a warrant covering the information sought; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) offers specific and articulable facts showing reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. A large online platform shall clearly and prominently disclose to platform users that information obtained by the platform through the platform&#39;s compliance with the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act will be released only pursuant to a court order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 8.

[_NEW MATERIAL_] IMPROPER DISSEMINATION OF COVERED SYNTHETIC\nCONTENT--CIVIL LIABILITY.--\n\nA. A private cause of action against a person for the nonconsensual\ndissemination of covered synthetic content exists when:\n\n(1) the person publicly disseminates covered synthetic content with:\n\n(a) knowledge that a depicted person in the covered synthetic content did not\nconsent to the dissemination; and\n\n(b) the intent to harass, entrap, defame, extort or otherwise cause financial\nor reputational harm to the depicted person;\n\n(2) the covered synthetic content realistically represents a depicted person\nengaging in conduct that the depicted person did not actually engage in; and\n\n(3) the depicted person is identifiable from:\n\n(a) the covered synthetic content alone; or\n\n(b) other personal information displayed or disseminated in connection with\nthe covered synthetic content.\n\nB. The fact that a depicted person consents to the creation of covered\nsynthetic content or to the nonpublic distribution of the covered synthetic\ncontent shall not constitute a defense to liability for a person who\nimproperly disseminates the covered synthetic content as provided in\nSubsection A of this section.\n\nC. A person shall not be liable for improper dissemination of covered\nsynthetic content as provided in Subsection A of this section if:\n\n(1) the dissemination is made:\n\n(a) for the purpose of a criminal investigation or prosecution that is\notherwise lawful;\n\n(b) for the purpose of or in connection with a report of unlawful conduct to\nappropriate authorities; or\n\n(c) in the course of seeking or receiving medical or mental health treatment,\nand the covered synthetic content is protected from further dissemination by\nthe recipient;\n\n(2) the person who disseminated the covered synthetic content commercially\nobtained the content for the purpose of the person's lawful sale of goods or\nservices, including artistic creations, and the depicted person knew that the\ncovered synthetic content would be created and disseminated commercially;\n\n(3) the covered synthetic content relates to a matter of public interest; the\ndissemination of the content serves a lawful public purpose; and the person\nthat disseminates the content clearly identifies that the content is covered\nsynthetic content;\n\n(4) the dissemination is for legitimate scientific research or educational\npurposes, the covered synthetic content is clearly identified as such and the\nperson who disseminates the content acts in good faith to minimize the risk\nthat the covered synthetic content will be further disseminated;\n\n(5) the dissemination is made for use in legal proceedings and:\n\n(a) is consistent with common practice in civil proceedings necessary for the\nproper functioning of the court system; or\n\n(b) the content is protected by court order that prohibits any further\ndissemination; or\n\n(6) the dissemination constitutes criticism, comment, satire, parody, news\nreporting, teaching, scholarship or research and a reasonable consumer\nreceiving the content would not believe it to accurately represent the\ndepicted person's speech or conduct.\n\nD. In a civil action filed pursuant to this section, the court may issue an\norder to protect the privacy of the plaintiff, including protection by:\n\n(1) allowing the plaintiff to use a pseudonym in any documents filed in the\naction that will be publicly available;\n\n(2) requiring the parties to the action to redact all of the plaintiff's\npersonal identifying information from any documents filed in the action that\nwill be publicly available or to file such documents under seal; or\n\n(3) issuing a protective order for purposes of discovery in the action, which\nmay include an order indicating that any intimate visual depiction or digital\nforgery shall remain in the care, custody and control of the court.\n\nE. In an action filed pursuant to this section, a prevailing plaintiff may\nrecover reasonable attorney fees and costs and:\n\n(1) liquidated damages in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000); or\n\n(2) actual damages sustained by the plaintiff.\n\nSECTION 4. [_NEW MATERIAL_] IMPROPER DISSEMINATION OF COVERED SYNTHETIC\nCONTENT--CRIMINAL LIABILITY.--\n\nA. Improper dissemination of covered synthetic content consists of knowingly\ndisseminating or presenting any likeness of an identifiable person in covered\nsynthetic content with the purpose of harassing, entrapping, defaming,\nextorting or otherwise causing financial or reputational harm to the depicted\nperson.\n\nB. A person who commits improper dissemination of covered synthetic content is\nguilty of a fourth degree felony and shall be sentenced pursuant to the\nprovisions of Section 31-18-15 NMSA 1978.\n\nC. The attorney general and the district attorney in the county with\njurisdiction shall have concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of\nthis section.\n\nSECTION 5. [_NEW MATERIAL_] IDENTIFICATION OF, LABELING AND CLASSIFYING\nSYNTHETIC CONTENT.--\n\nA. A provider shall place an imperceptible watermark that is designed to be as\ndifficult to remove as is reasonably possible using state-of-the-art\ntechniques into covered synthetic content that is produced or significantly\nmodified by a generative artificial intelligence system that the provider\nmakes available. A watermark shall:\n\n(1) identify content as synthetic and identify the provider to ensure that if\na sample of the content is corrupted, downscaled, cropped or otherwise\ndamaged, the watermark information will remain; and\n\n(2) be compatible with widely used industry standards.\n\nB. If covered synthetic content is too small to directly contain the required\nprovenance data that is part of a watermark, the provider shall, at a minimum,\nattempt to embed provenance data into the content that identifies the content\nas partially or entirely synthetic and communicates the following provenance\ndata in order of priority:\n\n(1) the name of the provider;\n\n(2) the name and version number of the artificial intelligence system that\ngenerated the content; (3) the time and date the content was created; and\n\n(4) if applicable, the specific portions of the content that are synthetic.\n\nC. A provider shall:\n\n(1) make available, at no cost to the public, a watermark decoder that:\n\n(a) provides an easy and quick method for a user of the decoder to assess the\nprovenance of a single piece of content; and\n\n(b) to the greatest extent possible, adheres to relevant national or\ninternational standards;\n\n(2) before the release of any new generative artificial intelligence system,\nand annually thereafter, conduct artificial intelligence red-teaming involving\nthird-party experts to test whether watermarks in the system can be easily\nremoved from covered synthetic content produced by a provider's generative\nartificial intelligence system, as well as whether the provider's generative\nartificial intelligence systems can be used to falsely add watermarks to\notherwise nonsynthetic content;\n\n(3) if the provider allows its generative artificial intelligence system to be\ndownloaded and modified, conduct additional artificial intelligence red-\nteaming to assess whether the provider's system's watermark functionalities\ncan be disabled without authorization;\n\n(4) make summaries of its artificial intelligence red-teaming exercises\npublicly available in electronic form and provide a clearly labeled link to\nthe summaries on the provider's internet website home page. The link shall be\nsimilar in appearance and size relative to other links on the same web page.\nThe provider shall remove from the summaries any details that pose an\nimmediate risk to public safety or provide information that could be used to\ndisable or circumvent the functionality of watermarks specified in the\nArtificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act;\n\n(5) submit a full report of each artificial intelligence red-teaming exercise\nit conducts to the attorney general within six months of completion of the\nexercise;\n\n(6) within ninety-six hours of discovering a material vulnerability or failure\nin a generative artificial intelligence system related to the erroneous or\nmalicious inclusion or removal of provenance data or watermarks, report the\nvulnerability or failure to the attorney general; and:\n\n(a) notify other providers that may be affected by similar vulnerabilities or\nfailures in a manner that allows the other providers to protect their own\nartificial intelligence systems but does not compromise the reporting\nprovider's systems or disclose the reporting provider's confidential or\nproprietary information; and\n\n(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to notify parties affected by the\nvulnerability or failure identified, including notification to online\nplatforms, researchers or users who received incorrect results from a\nwatermark decoder or users who produced covered synthetic content that\ncontained incorrect or insufficient provenance data; provided, however, that a\nprovider shall not be required to notify an affected party whose contact\ninformation the provider has not previously collected or retained; and\n\n(7) make any report to the attorney general required pursuant to this section\npublicly available by providing a clearly labeled link to the report on the\nprovider's internet website home page. The link shall be similar in appearance\nand size relative to other links on the same web page; provided, however, that\nif public disclosure of the report could or does present public safety risks,\na provider may instead:\n\n(a) post a summary disclosure of the reported material vulnerability or\nfailure; or\n\n(b) for no longer than thirty days, delay the public disclosure of the report\nuntil the public safety risks have been mitigated. If a provider delays public\ndisclosure, the provider shall also document all efforts to resolve the\nmaterial vulnerability or failure as quickly as possible.\n\nD. A provider and any distributor of software or online services shall not\nmake available to any person a system, application, tool or service that is\ndesigned to remove watermarks from covered synthetic content.\n\nE. A large online platform shall use the provenance data of content and state-\nof-the-art techniques to classify content that is uploaded by users. If the\nlarge online platform is able to detect and interpret the provenance data of\ncontent, using that provenance data, the large online platform shall classify\nthe content as \"fully synthetic\", \"partially synthetic\", \"nonsynthetic\" or\n\"nonsynthetic with minor modifications\". If content uploaded to or distributed\non a large online platform by a user does not contain provenance data, or if\nthe provenance data cannot be interpreted or detected by the platform, the\nplatform shall classify the content as \"content of unknown provenance\".\n\nF. For content classified as content of unknown provenance according to\nSubsection E of this section, a large online platform shall further use state-\nof-the-art techniques to classify content as \"possibly covered synthetic\ncontent with unknown provenance\" or \"possibly nonsynthetic content of unknown\nprovenance\".\n\nG. A large online platform shall use labels to disclose the classification\nassigned to content in accordance with this section. The labels shall\nprominently display whether content was classified using provenance data or\nstate-of-the-art techniques and which classification the content was assigned,\nas provided in Subsections E and F of this section. If content was classified\naccording to provenance data, the platform shall ensure that a user is able to\nclick or tap on a label to inspect provenance data, which shall be presented\nin a clear and simple format. If content was classified according to state-of-\nthe-art techniques, the platform shall include an additional label that warns\nusers that the technique may have incorrectly classified the content and\ndiscloses the approximate error rate of the technique used to classify the\ncontent.\n\nH. Disclosures required pursuant to this section shall be readily legible to\nan average viewer or, if the disclosure is made in audio format, shall be\nclearly audible. A disclosure in audio form shall occur at the beginning and\nend of a piece of audio content and shall be presented in a prominent manner\nand at a comparable volume and speaking cadence as other spoken words in the\ncontent.\n\nI. A user of a large online platform shall have reasonable opportunity to\nappeal the classification of content by a large online platform.\n\nSECTION 6. [_NEW MATERIAL_] ENFORCEMENT.--\n\nA. The attorney general may enforce the provisions of the Artificial\nIntelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act and may promulgate any rules\nnecessary to implement and enforce the provisions of that act.\n\nB. Prior to filing a civil action to enforce the Artificial Intelligence\nSynthetic Content Accountability Act, the attorney general may issue a civil\ninvestigative demand based on a reasonable belief that a person may be in\npossession, custody or control of an original or copy of any book, record,\nreport, memorandum, paper, communication, tabulation, map, chart, photograph,\nmechanical transcription or other document or recording relevant to the\nsubject matter of an investigation of a probable violation of that act. A\nperson issued an investigative demand shall produce the material sought and\nshall permit it to be copied and inspected. The demand of the attorney general\nand any material produced in response to it shall not be a matter of public\nrecord and shall not be published by the attorney general except by order of\nthe court.\n\nC. Upon reasonable belief that there has been a violation of the Artificial\nIntelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act, the attorney general:\n\n(1) may bring an action in the name of the state to enforce that act;\n\n(2) may petition the district court for injunctive relief;\n\n(3) shall not be required to post bond when seeking a temporary or permanent\ninjunction; and\n\n(4) may recover on behalf of the state a penalty of not less than five\nthousand dollars ($5,000) and not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for\neach violation of that act.\n\nSECTION 7. [_NEW MATERIAL_] POSTING SYNTHETIC CONTENT--IDENTITY VERIFICATION\nREQUIRED.--\n\nA. A large online platform shall use a reasonable identity verification method\nto verify a platform user's identity before allowing the user to post content\non the platform if the content:\n\n(1) was classified by the platform as fully synthetic, partially synthetic or\npossibly covered synthetic content of unknown provenance as provided in the\nArtificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act; and\n\n(2) purports to depict reality.\n\nB. The verification process provided for in Subsection A of this section shall\nbe performed each time a platform user attempts to post content that meets the\ndescriptions in Paragraph (1) or (2) of that subsection or if more than sixty\nminutes has elapsed since the previous verification was performed in\nconnection with that user's content; provided, however, that verification\nshall not be required to be performed more frequently than every sixty\nminutes.\n\nC. A large online platform shall protect any information obtained while\nperforming actions required pursuant to this section using, at a minimum, the\nindustry standard to protect users' most sensitive information, including\nmedical or financial data.\n\nD. A large online platform shall not use identification information provided\nby a user or obtained by the platform in the process of actions required\npursuant to this section for any purpose other than compliance with this\nsection.\n\nE. A large online platform shall disclose information obtained pursuant to\nactions performed pursuant to this section only as required by a court order.\nA court shall only issue an order for disclosure of such information in a\ncivil case if:\n\n(1) the plaintiff in the case undertakes efforts to notify the person that\nposted the content and whose information was obtained through a verification\nprocess pursuant to this section that they are the subject of a subpoena or\napplication for an order of disclosure, and the person has had a reasonable\nopportunity to oppose the subpoena or application;\n\n(2) the plaintiff identifies and sets forth the exact statements or provides\ninformation sufficient to identify the content about which the case was filed;\n\n(3) the plaintiff sets forth a prima facie case against the person that posted\nthe content and whose information was obtained through a verification process\npursuant to this section by producing evidence for each element of the cause\nof action; and\n\n(4) the court determines that the rights of the person that posted the content\nand whose information was obtained through a verification process pursuant to\nthis section under the first amendment to the United States constitution are\noutweighed by the strength of the prima facie case presented by the plaintiff\nand the necessity for the disclosure of the person's identity.\n\nF. A large online platform shall disclose information obtained through actions\nperformed pursuant to this section only as required by a court order. A court\nshall only issue an order for disclosure of such information in a criminal\ncase if the attorney general:\n\n(1) has a warrant covering the information sought; or\n\n(2) offers specific and articulable facts showing reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing\ncriminal investigation.\n\nG. A large online platform shall clearly and prominently disclose to platform\nusers that information obtained by the platform through the platform's\ncompliance with the Artificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability\nAct will be released only pursuant to a court order.\n\nSECTION 8. [_NEW MATERIAL_] SEVERABILITY.--If any part or application of the\nArtificial Intelligence Synthetic Content Accountability Act is held invalid,\nthe remainder of its application to other situations or persons shall not be\naffected.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
