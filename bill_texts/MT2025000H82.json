After considering the petition, the court may change the offender&#39;s risk level designation if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender&#39;s risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has changed since the time sentence was imposed.

Any offender without a risk assessment or psychosexual evaluation shall, at the offender&#39;s expense, undergo a psychosexual evaluation with a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as provided for in 37-1-139. The results of the psychosexual evaluation may be requested by the attorney general or a county attorney for purposes of petitioning a district court to assign a risk level designation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) The lack of a fixed residence is a factor that may be considered by the sentencing court or by the department in determining the risk level to be assigned to an offender pursuant to this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) Upon obtaining information that indicates that a sexual offender who is required to register under this part does not have a level 1, 2, or 3 designation, the offender, the attorney general, the county attorney that prosecuted the offender and obtained a conviction for a sexual offense, or the county attorney for the county in which the offender resides may, at any time, petition the district court that sentenced the offender for a sexual offense or the district court for the judicial district in which the offender resides to designate the offender as level 1, 2, or 3. Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report at the petitioner&#39;s expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all parties.

After considering the petition, the court may change the offender&#39;s risk level designation if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the offender&#39;s risk of committing a repeat sexual offense has changed since the time sentence was imposed.

Any offender without a risk assessment or psychosexual evaluation shall, at the offender&#39;s expense, undergo a psychosexual evaluation with a sexual offender evaluator who has a license endorsement as provided for in 37-1-139.

Upon the filing of the petition, the court may order a psychosexual evaluation report at the petitioner&#39;s expense, or order that the results of all prior psychosexual evaluations be provided to all parties.

After considering the petition, the court may\nchange the offender's risk level designation if the court finds by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the offender's risk of committing a repeat sexual\noffense has changed since the time sentence was imposed.
