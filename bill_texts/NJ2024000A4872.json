WIMBERLY\n\nDistrict 35 (Bergen and Passaic)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nProhibits certain coordination among residential rental property owners who\nrestrict competition with respect to residential dwelling units.\n\nCURRENT VERSION OF TEXT\n\nAs reported by the Assembly Housing Committee on October 24, 2024, with\namendments.\n\nAn Act concerning _certain coordination in residential_ rental property\npricing and supplementing P.L.1970, c.73 (C.56:9-1 et seq.).\n\nBe It Enacted by the Senate and General Assembly of the State of New Jersey:\n\n1\\. The Legislature finds and declares that:\n\na. New Jersey is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis, as demonstrated\nby rental housing industry data showing median rent for a three-bedroom\napartment increasing by 35 percent in the State from 2021 through 2024 and a\nstudio in a more urban environment such as Hoboken increasing by 61 percent in\nthe same timeframe.\n\nb. Data from the United States Census Bureau indicates that over 50 percent of\nrenters in New Jersey are deemed \"rent burdened,\" which means an individual\nspends more than 30 percent of income on rent.\n\nc. Recent national data indicates that landlords of residential rental housing\nuse property management software to collude and raise residential rental\nhousing prices, which may have contributed to recent increases in the State.\n\nd. Landlords engaging with the software supply real-time prices and additional\nlease information to companies managing the software, who proceed to use\nalgorithms to fix rental prices. As a result, competition decreases and\ntypically rental prices increase.\n\ne. A leading property management software company in the United States hinted\nat the outcome of using its software by stating on its website that it enables\nlandlords to \"outperform the market\" by two to five percent, with a company\nexecutive publicly stating that the software could be responsible for rent\nincreases of up to 14.5 percent.\n\nf. New Jersey recognizes housing as a basic human need and endeavors to expand\naccess to affordable housing.\n\n2\\. As used in this act:\n\n\"Consciously parallel pricing coordination\" means a tacit _or express_\nagreement between two or more rental property owners _that are not related by\na business agreement or contract_ to raise, lower, change, maintain, or\nmanipulate pricing for the purchase or sale of reasonably interchangeable\nproducts or services _unless required to do so in accordance with a rental\ncost restriction program.
