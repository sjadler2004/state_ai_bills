Provides that a generative\nartificial intelligence tool provider shall apply provenance data, either\ndirectly or through the use of third-party technology, to wholly-generated\nsynthetic content generated by the provider's generative artificial\nintelligence tool. Sets forth additional requirements on generative artificial\nintelligence tool providers, large online platforms, and manufacturers of\ncapture devices. Defines terms.\n\n**A BILL FOR**\n\nAN ACT concerning business.\n\n**Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, represented in the\nGeneral Assembly:**\n\nSection 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Provenance Data\nRequirements Act.\n\nSection 5. Definitions. As used in this Act:\n\n\"Artificial intelligence\" means a machine-based system that, for explicit or\nimplicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate\noutputs, such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can\ninfluence physical or virtual environments. For the purposes of this\ndefinition a system that uses \"artificial intelligence\" may vary in its level\nof autonomy and adaptations after deployment.\n\n\"Capture device\" means a device that can record photographs, audio, or video\ncontent, including, but not limited to, video and still photography cameras,\nmobile phones with built-in cameras or microphones, and voice recorders.\n\n\"Content\" means any visual or audio digital content.\n\n\"Generative artificial intelligence model\" means an artificial intelligence\nmodel designed to generate new data or content based on the patterns or\nstructures from its training data.\n\n\"Generative artificial intelligence model\" does not include nongenerative\ncapabilities like classification, predictions, or labeling.\n\n\"Generative artificial intelligence tool provider\" means an entity that\ndevelops a generative artificial intelligence tool that is made publicly\navailable for use by people in this State.\n\n\"Generative artificial intelligence tool\" means a product or feature that\nprovides the outputs from a generative artificial intelligence model to end\nusers.\n\n\"Large online platform\" means a public-facing social media platform, content-\nsharing platform, messaging platform, advertising network, or standalone\nsearch engine that distributes content to users who did not create or\ncollaborate in creating the content. For the purposes of this definition, a\n\"large online platform\" shall have 1,000,000 or more unique monthly users\nduring the preceding 12-month period.\n\n\"Provenance application tool\" means a tool or online service that makes\nprovenance data difficult to remove and allows users to easily apply\nprovenance data.\n\n\"Provenance data\" means information, such as the origin of a piece of content\nand the history of modifications to the content, that is in a format that is\ncompliant with widely-adopted guidelines or specifications promulgated by an\nestablished standards-setting body, and includes, but is not limited to:\n\n(1) whether some or all of the content is synthetic content; and\n\n(2) when there is synthetic content, the name of the generative artificial\nprovider whose generative artificial tool generated the synthetic content.\n\n\"Provenance reader\" means a tool or service that allows users to view\nprovenance data and its integrity.\n\n\"Synthetic content\" means visual or audio content that has been produced or\nmodified by a generative artificial tool.\n\nSection 10. Operative provisions for generative artificial intelligence tools.\n\n(a) A generative artificial intelligence tool provider shall apply provenance\ndata, either directly or through the use of third-party technology, to wholly-\ngenerated synthetic content generated by the provider's generative artificial\nintelligence tool.\n\n(b) A generative artificial intelligence tool provider shall make available a\nprovenance application tool that enables the user to apply provenance data,\neither directly or through the use of third-party technology, to content that\nhas been significantly modified to include synthetic content.\n\n(c) A generative artificial intelligence tool provider shall make a provenance\nreader available to the public.\n\nSection 15. Operative provisions for large online platforms. A large online\nplatform shall:\n\n(1) retain any available provenance data in content provided to or posted on\nthe large online platform; and\n\n(2) make available to a consumer of content in this State either (i) the\nprovenance data or a conspicuous indicator that provenance data is available.\n\nSection 20. Operative provisions for capture devices. A manufacturer of a\ncapture device shall include the ability for a user to enable the inclusion of\nprovenance data in the user's captured content.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
