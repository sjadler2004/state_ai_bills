Water resources: demands: data centers.\n\n~~Existing law authorizes the legislative body of an incorporated city and the\ncounty board of supervisors to license businesses carried on within their\nrespective jurisdictions and to set license fees, as specified.~~\n\n~~This bill would require a person who owns or operates a data center, as\ndefined, to provide, when applying to a city or a county for an initial\nbusiness license, equivalent instrument, or permit, under penalty of perjury,\non the application, an estimate of the expected water use. The bill would\nrequire a person who owns or operates a data center to provide, when applying\nto a city or county for a renewal of a business license, equivalent\ninstrument, or permit, under penalty of perjury, on the application, a report\nof the annual water use. By expanding the crime of perjury, the bill would\nimpose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require a city or county\nto require a data center operating within its jurisdiction, as a condition for\nobtaining or renewing a business license, to meet efficiency standards, as\ndetermined by the local jurisdiction, as provided. By imposing additional\nduties on cities and counties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local\nprogram.~~\n\nExisting law establishes the State Energy Resources Conservation and\nDevelopment Commission with various responsibilities with respect to\ndeveloping and implementing the state's energy policies. Existing law\nestablishes the Department of Water Resources within the Natural Resources\nAgency and prescribes the powers and responsibilities of the department.\n\nThis bill would require the department and the commission to develop\nguidelines and best~~practices~~ _practices, as specified,_ to maximize the\nuse of natural resources to address the developing and emerging needs of\ntechnology in California that are consistent with urban water use objectives,\nas provided, and specified federal law.\n\n_Existing law authorizes the legislative body of an incorporated city and the\ncounty board of supervisors to license businesses carried on within their\nrespective jurisdictions and to set license fees, as specified._\n\n_This bill would require a person who owns or operates a data center, as\ndefined, prior to applying to a city or a county for an initial business\nlicense, equivalent instrument, or permit, to provide its water supplier,\nunder penalty of perjury, an estimate of the expected water use. When applying\nto a city or county for an initial business license, the bill would require a\nperson who owns or operates a data center to self-certify, under penalty of\nperjury, on the application that the person has provided its water supplier an\nestimate of the expected water use. When applying to a city or county for a\nrenewal of a business license, equivalent instrument, or permit, the bill\nwould require a person who owns or operates a data center to self-certify,\nunder penalty of perjury, on the application, a report of the annual water\nuse. As a condition for obtaining or renewing a business license, the bill\nwould require that a person who owns or operates a data center self-certify,\nunder penalty of perjury, that the data center will meet the above-described\nefficiency guidelines and best practices. By expanding the crime of perjury,\nthe bill would impose a state-mandated local program._\n\nExisting law requires a public entity, as defined, to conduct a water usage\ndemand analysis, as defined, prior to completing, or as part of, a cost-of-\nservice analysis conducted to set fees and charges for water service that are\nconsistent with applicable law. Existing law requires a public entity to\nidentify, within the water usage demand analysis, the costs of water service\nfor the highest users, as defined, incurred by the public entity, and the\naverage annual volume of water delivered to high water users.\n\nThis bill would require a public entity to additionally identify, within the\nabove-described water usage demand analysis, the average volume of water\ndelivered to data centers. By requiring a higher level of service of public\nentities, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a\nmatter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore,\napply to all cities, including charter cities.\n\n~~The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies\nand school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory\nprovisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.~~\n\n~~This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no\nreimbursement is required by this act for specified reasons.~~\n\n~~With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the\nCommission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so\nmandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to\nthe statutory provisions noted above.~~\n\n_The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies\nand school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.
