Participating landlords provide vast amounts of proprietary data to the programs, which in turn set or provide recommendations for rent and occupancy rates.

Numerous antitrust lawsuits have been filed against certain of these companies, including RealPage, Inc. and Yardi Systems, Inc. The lawsuits allege that these companies are enabling and participating in a scheme of unlawful price fixing.
