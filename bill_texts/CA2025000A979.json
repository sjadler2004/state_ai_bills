The Legislature finds and declares that Section 2 of this act, which\namends Section 8586.5 of the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the\npublic's right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of\npublic officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of\nthe California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the\nLegislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected\nby this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:\n\nThe state has a very strong interest in protecting its information technology\nsystems from intrusion because those systems contain confidential information\nand play a critical role in the performance of the duties of state government.\nThus, information regarding the specific vulnerabilities of those systems must\nbe protected to preclude use of that information to facilitate attacks on\nthose systems.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
