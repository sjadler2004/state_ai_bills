Pupil instruction: high schools: computer science courses: implementation guide.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Existing law requires the adopted course of study for grades 7 to 12, inclusive, to offer courses in specified areas of study, including, among others, science and mathematics.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require the governing board of each school district, and the governing body of each charter school, maintaining any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, by January 1, 2027, to (A) adopt a plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting to offer at least one course in computer science in each of its high schools in accordance with a specified timeline, (B) post the plan to its internet website, and (C) review, on or before May 31, 2027, and annually thereafter, the plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting and report to the public on the plan&#39;s implementation, as provided. The bill would require school districts and charter schools to describe in the adopted plan their planned efforts to increase the computer science course enrollment of female pupils, pupils with disabilities, pupils who belong to ethnic and racial groups, and pupils eligible for free or reduced-priced meals that are underrepresented in the field of computer science. By imposing additional duties on school districts and charter schools, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would require the State Department of Education, on or before June 30, 2028, and annually thereafter, to publicly post specified computer science course-related data on its internet website, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Existing law creates the California Computer Science Coordinator, as a position within the department, to provide statewide coordination in, among other things, implementing the computer science content standards and leading the implementation of the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan, as provided.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require the department, by July 1, 2026, and under the direction of the California Computer Science Coordinator, to develop a computer science implementation guide that would include specified information regarding computer science standards-aligned courses, as provided, and would encourage school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to review the computer science implementation guide developed by the department.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) In 2014, Assembly Member Curt Hagman authored, and Governor Jerry Brown signed, Assembly Bill 1539 of the 2013-14 Regular Session, directing the Instructional Quality Commission to consider developing, and recommending to the State Board of Education, computer science content standards, on or before July 31, 2019, pursuant to recommendations developed by a group of computer science experts. The Instructional Quality Commission recommended computer science standards to the State Board of Education in July 2018, and that state board adopted those standards in September 2018.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) In 2016, Assembly Member Susan Bonilla authored, and Governor Jerry Brown signed, Assembly Bill 2329 of the 2015-16 Regular Session, to require the State Board of Education to create a California Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan (CSSIP). The CSSIP was developed by 23 CSSIP Advisory Panel members, appointed or designated by a variety of entities, including the Governor, the Senate Committee on Rules, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The CSSIP Advisory Panel members had expertise in computer science and included educators from higher education and K-12 educational entities, superintendents, researchers, representatives from industry, and others. The CSSIP recommendations were submitted to the State Department of Education, the State Board of Education, and the Legislature in September 2018 and approved by the State Board of Education in May 2019. The vision statement of the CSSIP states, &quot;California&#39;s vision is to ensure that all students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science to prepare them for college, careers, and civic engagement.&quot; The mission statement of the CSSIP states, &quot;All schools offer rigorous and relevant computer science education equitably and sustainably throughout grades K-12. All teachers are adequately prepared to teach rigorous and relevant computer science aligned with the California K-12 Computer Science Standards (CA K-12 CS Standards).&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Studies on computer science education prove that computer science education develops computational, critical thinking, and problem solving skills that are foundational knowledge for all pupils, regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation. The Computer Science Standards for California Public Schools, Kindergarten through Grade Twelve, were adopted unanimously by the State Board of Education in 2018, and the Computer Science Strategic Implementation Plan states, &quot;computer science for all ensures each and every student develops foundational conceptual knowledge and proficiency in computer science practices to provide the skills to responsibly and productively participate in a world in which digital technologies are broadly integrated.&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Despite the value of computer science education, the most recent available data shows that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Forty-nine percent of high schools in California do not offer a single course in computer science.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Just 5 percent of the 1,930,000 high school pupils in California are enrolled in a computer science course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Only 34 percent of schools serving high proportions of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and Pacific Islander pupils offer computer science courses, compared to 52 percent of schools serving a greater proportion of White and Asian pupils.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) While female pupils comprise 49 percent of the high school population, just 30 percent of pupils taking computer science courses are female.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(E) Schools serving low-income communities are three times less likely to offer core computer science courses, and over two times less likely to offer Advanced Placement courses, than schools serving high-income communities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(F) Rural schools are two times less likely to offer computer science courses than urban schools.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) The introduction of the California Computer Science Standards for Public Schools: Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (the California computer science standards) highlights the importance of inclusive computer science opportunities, stating &quot;The standards are designed for each and every student, including underserved populations: girls, low-income students, homeless students, rural students, African American and Latinx students, students who are English learners, students with disabilities, and foster youth. Students&#39; access to and achievement in computer science must not be predictable on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, language, religion, sexual orientation, cultural affiliation, or special needs.&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) California lags behind the national average, and behind 36 other states, in the percentage of high schools offering at least one computer science course, making California in the lowest 25 percent of states.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) Thirty-two other states currently require high schools to offer a computer science course, with 11 of those states requiring a computer science course for graduation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) As of January 2023, California has 45,245 open computing jobs that have an average salary of $153,544, yet there were only 9,339 graduates in computer science in 2020. California has the highest number of open computing jobs in the nation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) A lack of diversity and representation in computer science and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has long been a concern. In April of 2021, the Pew Research Center indicated that Latinx and Black workers are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, while White and Asian workers are overrepresented. Women were reported to make up a mere quarter or less of all computer and engineering jobs. To address this issue, it is crucial to start early in the educational pipeline, which makes K-12 schools an ideal setting for nurturing diversity, inclusion, and equal access.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10) California has made significant investments in in-service professional development education opportunities in computer science for teachers throughout California. To date, California has invested $20,000,000 for professional learning for educators through the Educator Workforce Investment Grant Program for computer science. An additional $15,000,000 has been invested in the Computer Science Supplementary Authorization Incentive Grant Program to support educators in credentialing. The $50,000,000 Mathematics, Science, and Computer Science Professional Learning Grant reflects further investment in computer science, and Assembly Bill 1251 (Chapter 834, Statutes of 2023), requires the Commission on Teaching Credentialing to, upon appropriation by the Legislature, convene a workgroup to discuss options for expanding credentialing options for computer science.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) In accordance with the concepts in the California computer science standards, a comprehensive computer science foundation for pupils includes conceptual understanding and skills of the five concept areas of the standards, which are computing systems, networks and the internet, data and analysis, algorithms and programming, and impacts of computing. Artificial intelligence (AI) touches upon each of these concept areas. Computer science is referred to as a core subject in the State Board of Education-adopted California computer science standards, designed for all K-12 pupils. In alignment with these K-12 standards, as pupils gain the ability to navigate computing systems, utilize networks and the internet responsibly, analyze and interpret data with an antibias lens, solve problems using algorithms and programming, and carefully consider the ethics of computing technologies, they become informed digital citizens who can leverage AI and other technologies to promote social justice and equity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(12) The importance of computer science is recognized at a national level, with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95) including computer science as part of a &quot;well-rounded education.&quot; Computer science concepts permeate nearly every industry in our midst, with the California computer science standards emphasizing its interdisciplinary nature and relevance in our digitally connected society for computer science.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure all California public high schools operated by school districts and charter schools offer computer science.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SEC. 2. Section 51220.8 is added to the Education Code, to read:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">51220.8. (a) (1) By January 1, 2027, the governing board of each school district, and the governing body of each charter school, maintaining any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, shall adopt a plan at a regularly scheduled public meeting to offer at least one course in computer science in accordance with all of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) (i) Commencing with the 2027-28 school year, at least one high school per school district offers a computer science course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), school districts maintaining only one high school instead offer a computer science course by no later than the 2028-29 school year.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Commencing with the 2028-29 school year, all charter schools maintaining any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, offer a computer science course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Commencing with the 2028-29 school year, at least 50 percent of the high schools per school district offer a computer science course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Commencing with the 2029-30 school year, all high schools in a school district offer a computer science course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) School districts and charter schools shall post the required plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) on their respective internet website and shall otherwise make them available upon the request of the department.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) On or before May 31, 2027, and annually thereafter until each high school in a school district or each charter school maintaining any of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, as applicable, offers a computer science course, the governing board of a school district and the governing body of a charter school shall review the required plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) at a regularly scheduled public meeting and report to the public on its progress in implementing the plan.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) &quot;Computer science&quot; means the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, hardware and software designs, implementation, and impact on society, as described in the computer science academic content standards adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 60605.4.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) &quot;Computer science course&quot; means a computer science course that is aligned to the computer science academic content standards adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 60605.4 and in which pupils do not merely use technology as passive consumers, but understand why and how computing technologies work, and then build upon that conceptual knowledge by creating computational artifacts.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) If a traditional classroom setting for a computer science course is not feasible, the school district or charter school shall include its plan to offer a virtual or distance course option in the required plan adopted pursuant to subdivision (a).

(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(1) In 2014, Assembly Member Curt Hagman authored, and Governor Jerry Brown\nsigned, Assembly Bill 1539 of the 2013-14 Regular Session, directing the\nInstructional Quality Commission to consider developing, and recommending to\nthe State Board of Education, computer science content standards, on or before\nJuly 31, 2019, pursuant to recommendations developed by a group of computer\nscience experts. The Instructional Quality Commission recommended computer\nscience standards to the State Board of Education in July 2018, and that state\nboard adopted those standards in September 2018.\n\n(2) In 2016, Assembly Member Susan Bonilla authored, and Governor Jerry Brown\nsigned, Assembly Bill 2329 of the 2015-16 Regular Session, to require the\nState Board of Education to create a California Computer Science Strategic\nImplementation Plan (CSSIP). The CSSIP was developed by 23 CSSIP Advisory\nPanel members, appointed or designated by a variety of entities, including the\nGovernor, the Senate Committee on Rules, the Speaker of the Assembly, and the\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction. The CSSIP Advisory Panel members had\nexpertise in computer science and included educators from higher education and\nK-12 educational entities, superintendents, researchers, representatives from\nindustry, and others. The CSSIP recommendations were submitted to the State\nDepartment of Education, the State Board of Education, and the Legislature in\nSeptember 2018 and approved by the State Board of Education in May 2019. The\nvision statement of the CSSIP states, \"California's vision is to ensure that\nall students develop foundational knowledge and skills in computer science to\nprepare them for college, careers, and civic engagement.\" The mission\nstatement of the CSSIP states, \"All schools offer rigorous and relevant\ncomputer science education equitably and sustainably throughout grades K-12.\nAll teachers are adequately prepared to teach rigorous and relevant computer\nscience aligned with the California K-12 Computer Science Standards (CA K-12\nCS Standards).\"\n\n(3) Studies on computer science education prove that computer science\neducation develops computational, critical thinking, and problem solving\nskills that are foundational knowledge for all pupils, regardless of their\nultimate field of study or occupation. The Computer Science Standards for\nCalifornia Public Schools, Kindergarten through Grade Twelve, were adopted\nunanimously by the State Board of Education in 2018, and the Computer Science\nStrategic Implementation Plan states, \"computer science for all ensures each\nand every student develops foundational conceptual knowledge and proficiency\nin computer science practices to provide the skills to responsibly and\nproductively participate in a world in which digital technologies are broadly\nintegrated.\"\n\n(4) Despite the value of computer science education, the most recent available\ndata shows that:\n\n(A) Forty-nine percent of high schools in California do not offer a single\ncourse in computer science.\n\n(B) Just 5 percent of the 1,930,000 high school pupils in California are\nenrolled in a computer science course.\n\n(C) Only 34 percent of schools serving high proportions of Black, Indigenous,\nLatinx, and Pacific Islander pupils offer computer science courses, compared\nto 52 percent of schools serving a greater proportion of White and Asian\npupils.\n\n(D) While female pupils comprise 49 percent of the high school population,\njust 30 percent of pupils taking computer science courses are female.\n\n(E) Schools serving low-income communities are three times less likely to\noffer core computer science courses, and over two times less likely to offer\nAdvanced Placement courses, than schools serving high-income communities.\n\n(F) Rural schools are two times less likely to offer computer science courses\nthan urban schools.\n\n(5) The introduction of the California Computer Science Standards for Public\nSchools: Kindergarten Through Grade Twelve (the California computer science\nstandards) highlights the importance of inclusive computer science\nopportunities, stating \"The standards are designed for each and every student,\nincluding underserved populations: girls, low-income students, homeless\nstudents, rural students, African American and Latinx students, students who\nare English learners, students with disabilities, and foster youth. Students'\naccess to and achievement in computer science must not be predictable on the\nbasis of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, language, religion,\nsexual orientation, cultural affiliation, or special needs.\"\n\n(6) California lags behind the national average, and behind 36 other states,\nin the percentage of high schools offering at least one computer science\ncourse, making California in the lowest 25 percent of states.\n\n(7) Thirty-two other states currently require high schools to offer a computer\nscience course, with 11 of those states requiring a computer science course\nfor graduation.\n\n(8) As of January 2023, California has 45,245 open computing jobs that have an\naverage salary of $153,544, yet there were only 9,339 graduates in computer\nscience in 2020. California has the highest number of open computing jobs in\nthe nation.\n\n(9) A lack of diversity and representation in computer science and science,\ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields has long been a\nconcern. In April of 2021, the Pew Research Center indicated that Latinx and\nBlack workers are underrepresented in the STEM workforce, while White and\nAsian workers are overrepresented. Women were reported to make up a mere\nquarter or less of all computer and engineering jobs. To address this issue,\nit is crucial to start early in the educational pipeline, which makes K-12\nschools an ideal setting for nurturing diversity, inclusion, and equal access.\n\n(10) California has made significant investments in in-service professional\ndevelopment education opportunities in computer science for teachers\nthroughout California. To date, California has invested $20,000,000 for\nprofessional learning for educators through the Educator Workforce Investment\nGrant Program for computer science. An additional $15,000,000 has been\ninvested in the Computer Science Supplementary Authorization Incentive Grant\nProgram to support educators in credentialing. The $50,000,000 Mathematics,\nScience, and Computer Science Professional Learning Grant reflects further\ninvestment in computer science, and Assembly Bill 1251 (Chapter 834, Statutes\nof 2023), requires the Commission on Teaching Credentialing to, upon\nappropriation by the Legislature, convene a workgroup to discuss options for\nexpanding credentialing options for computer science.\n\n(11) In accordance with the concepts in the California computer science\nstandards, a comprehensive computer science foundation for pupils includes\nconceptual understanding and skills of the five concept areas of the\nstandards, which are computing systems, networks and the internet, data and\nanalysis, algorithms and programming, and impacts of computing. Artificial\nintelligence (AI) touches upon each of these concept areas. Computer science\nis referred to as a core subject in the State Board of Education-adopted\nCalifornia computer science standards, designed for all K-12 pupils. In\nalignment with these K-12 standards, as pupils gain the ability to navigate\ncomputing systems, utilize networks and the internet responsibly, analyze and\ninterpret data with an antibias lens, solve problems using algorithms and\nprogramming, and carefully consider the ethics of computing technologies, they\nbecome informed digital citizens who can leverage AI and other technologies to\npromote social justice and equity.\n\n(12) The importance of computer science is recognized at a national level,\nwith the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 114-95) including\ncomputer science as part of a \"well-rounded education.\" Computer science\nconcepts permeate nearly every industry in our midst, with the California\ncomputer science standards emphasizing its interdisciplinary nature and\nrelevance in our digitally connected society for computer science.\n\n(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to ensure all California public high\nschools operated by school districts and charter schools offer computer\nscience.\n\nSEC. 2. Section 51220.8 is added to the Education Code, to read:\n\n51220.8. (a) (1) By January 1, 2027, the governing board of each school\ndistrict, and the governing body of each charter school, maintaining any of\ngrades 9 to 12, inclusive, shall adopt a plan at a regularly scheduled public\nmeeting to offer at least one course in computer science in accordance with\nall of the following:\n\n(A) (i) Commencing with the 2027-28 school year, at least one high school per\nschool district offers a computer science course.\n\n(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), school districts maintaining only one high\nschool instead offer a computer science course by no later than the 2028-29\nschool year.\n\n(B) Commencing with the 2028-29 school year, all charter schools maintaining\nany of grades 9 to 12, inclusive, offer a computer science course.\n\n(C) Commencing with the 2028-29 school year, at least 50 percent of the high\nschools per school district offer a computer science course.\n\n(D) Commencing with the 2029-30 school year, all high schools in a school\ndistrict offer a computer science course.\n\n(2) School districts and charter schools shall post the required plan adopted\npursuant to paragraph (1) on their respective internet website and shall\notherwise make them available upon the request of the department.\n\n(3) On or before May 31, 2027, and annually thereafter until each high school\nin a school district or each charter school maintaining any of grades 9 to 12,\ninclusive, as applicable, offers a computer science course, the governing\nboard of a school district and the governing body of a charter school shall\nreview the required plan adopted pursuant to paragraph (1) at a regularly\nscheduled public meeting and report to the public on its progress in\nimplementing the plan.\n\n(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:\n\n(1) \"Computer science\" means the study of computers and algorithmic processes,\nincluding their principles, hardware and software designs, implementation, and\nimpact on society, as described in the computer science academic content\nstandards adopted by the state board pursuant to Section 60605.4.\n\n(2) \"Computer science course\" means a computer science course that is aligned\nto the computer science academic content standards adopted by the state board\npursuant to Section 60605.4 and in which pupils do not merely use technology\nas passive consumers, but understand why and how computing technologies work,\nand then build upon that conceptual knowledge by creating computational\nartifacts.\n\n(c) If a traditional classroom setting for a computer science course is not\nfeasible, the school district or charter school shall include its plan to\noffer a virtual or distance course option in the required plan adopted\npursuant to subdivision (a). The computer science course shall be listed as an\noption in the school's course catalog.\n\n(d) School districts and charter schools shall describe, in the required plan\nadopted pursuant to subdivision (a), its planned efforts to increase the\ncomputer science course enrollment of female pupils, pupils with disabilities,\npupils who belong to ethnic and racial groups, and pupils eligible for free or\nreduced-priced meals, as defined in Section 42238.01, that are\nunderrepresented in the field of computer science.\n\n(e) On or before June 30, 2028, and annually thereafter, the department shall\npublicly post the following course-related data for grades 9 to 12, inclusive,\non its internet website, disaggregated at the state, county, school district,\nand school levels, for computer science courses that are submitted and\ncertified by local educational agencies as part of the annual Fall 2\nsubmission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System\npursuant to Section 60900:\n\n(1) The names and course codes of computer science courses that pupils are\nenrolled in at each school.\n\n(2) The number and percentage of pupils who enrolled in each computer science\ncourse, disaggregated by each of the following:\n\n(A) Gender.\n\n(B) Race and ethnicity.\n\n(C) Special education status.\n\n(D) English learner status.\n\n(E) Socioeconomically disadvantaged status, including pupils who are eligible\nfor free or reduced-price meals, as defined in Section 42238.01.\n\n(F) Grade level.\n\nSEC. 3. Chapter 19 (commencing with Section 53310) is added to Part 28 of\nDivision 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:\n\nCHAPTER 19. Computer Science Implementation Guide\n\n53310\\.
