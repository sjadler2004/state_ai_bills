The legislature finds that Hawaii is facing an affordability crisis, which is pushing more young adults and families out of the State. The United States Census data shows that from 2020 to 2022, Oahu alone experienced a net loss of 31,682 residents due to domestic migration, continuing a trend of population decline. As the State with the highest cost of living in the nation and a tight and limited housing market, residents often struggle to get by, even when they are employed. Forty-two per cent of residents are unable to afford basic necessities and secure jobs that pay a sustainable wage, and fifty-seven per cent of Hawaii&#39;s college graduates are underemployed five years after completing college.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that state leaders have identified better access, analysis, and sharing of data as a key strategy to effectively address the affordability crisis. California, Colorado, and Washington have reformed their data systems to increase cross-agency collaboration and governance, bringing coherence to a complex web of different and siloed data systems, saving money, and bringing stronger visibility and collaboration around their needs. In these and other states, a centralized agency coordinates efforts to translate data between state departments and convenes partners and stakeholders to promote transparency and collaborative decision making.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature additionally finds that the State has many foundational elements for the effective use of data, including a chief data officer and the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership. However, while some departments are required to share data, existing law does not identify a centralized coordinating agency or office for this work, nor does it include guidelines around operations and reporting found in exemplar state models. This leaves limits to the analyses available to decision makers that could be improved through streamlined data sharing. For example, the Hawaii Data eXchange Partnership is currently unable to identify Hawaii public school graduates in Hawaii&#39;s workforce if they attended college out of state or at a private college, joined the military, or directly entered the workforce. This means that the State is unable to account for a significant number of young adults as they enter a critical point of their lives. For policymakers, this gap in knowledge highlights the difficulty in assessing whether investments in career pathways at the K-12 level are enabling graduates to attain a living wage and afford to live in the State. With a centralized agency to help match graduate records between the department of education and the department of labor and industrial relations these kinds of gaps could be directly addressed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds that establishing a permanent data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services is an important step for ensuring more effective, efficient, and impactful collaboration by state agencies and stakeholders.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of this Act is to establish a data sharing and governance working group within the office of enterprise technology services and coordinated by the chief data officer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2. Chapter 27, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is amended by adding a new section to part VII to be appropriately designated and to read as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;<b>\n     <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;
