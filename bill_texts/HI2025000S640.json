The legislature finds that modern chatbots are now advanced enough to engage with users in highly human-like conversations, making it difficult for users to determine if they are speaking with a chatbot or a real person. Many chatbots are also designed to mimic human behaviors and conversations, and can be used to effectively influence people in a variety of ways, from advertising to spreading misinformation, and can even manipulate users into revealing personal information such as their social security or bank account numbers. Additionally, chatbots are intended to learn and adapt through their interactions with users. As chatbots gather information from users, they become better able to help their developers achieve specific objectives, such as keeping users engaged or encouraging them to make a purchase.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature finds that there are few regulations requiring that companies or individuals make users aware that they are interacting with a chatbot. This lack of transparency means that individuals may mistakenly believe they are conversing with a licensed professional, such as a doctor, financial advisor, or therapist, when they are actually speaking with a chatbot. The legislature believes that consumers have a right to know when they are engaging with a chatbot or other technology that mimics human interaction.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the purpose of this Act is to require corporations, organizations, or individuals engaging in commercial transactions to inform consumers when the consumers are communicating or otherwise interacting with a chatbot or other technology that mimics human interaction.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2.
