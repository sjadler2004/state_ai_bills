The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 1. DUTIES AND RIGHTS OF THE SPEAKER</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER A. DUTIES AS PRESIDING OFFICER</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES. The speaker shall enforce, apply, and interpret the rules of the house in all deliberations of the house and shall enforce the legislative rules prescribed by the statutes and the Constitution of Texas.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. CALL TO ORDER. The speaker shall take the chair on each calendar day precisely at the hour to which the house adjourned or recessed at its last sitting and shall immediately call the members to order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. LAYING BUSINESS BEFORE THE HOUSE. The speaker shall lay before the house its business in the order indicated by the rules and shall receive propositions made by members and put them to the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. REFERRAL OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO COMMITTEE. All proposed legislation shall be referred by the speaker to an appropriate standing <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">committee, permanent standing subcommittee,</u> or select committee with jurisdiction, subject to correction by a majority vote of the house. A bill or resolution may not be referred simultaneously to more than one committee <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or subcommittee</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. PRESERVATION OF ORDER AND DECORUM. The speaker shall preserve order and decorum. In case of disturbance or disorderly conduct in the galleries or in the lobby, the speaker may order that these areas be cleared. No signs, placards, or other objects of similar nature shall be permitted in the rooms, lobby, gallery, and hall of the house. The speaker shall see that the members of the house conduct themselves in a civil manner in accordance with accepted standards of parliamentary conduct and may, when necessary, order the sergeant-at-arms to clear the aisles and seat the members of the house so that business may be conducted in an orderly manner.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. RECOGNITION OF GALLERY VISITORS. On written request of a member, the speaker may recognize persons in the gallery. The speaker shall afford that recognition at a convenient place in the order of business, considering the need for order and decorum and the need for continuity of debate. The request must be made on a form prescribed by the Committee on House Administration. The speaker may recognize, at a time he or she considers appropriate during floor proceedings, the person serving as physician of the day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. STATING AND VOTING ON QUESTIONS. The speaker shall rise to put a question but may state it sitting. The question shall be put substantially in this form: &quot;The question occurs on</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">______&quot; (here state the question or proposition under consideration). &quot;All in favor say &#39;Aye,&#39;&quot; and after the affirmative vote is expressed, &quot;All opposed say &#39;No.&#39;&quot; If the speaker is in doubt as to the result, or if a division is called for, the house shall divide: those voting in the affirmative on the question shall register &quot;Aye&quot; on the voting machine, and those voting in the negative on the question shall register &quot;No.&quot; The decision of the house on the question shall be printed in the journal and shall include the yeas and nays if a record of the yeas and nays is ordered in accordance with the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. VOTING RIGHTS OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The speaker shall have the same right as other members to vote. If the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, has not voted, he or she may cast the deciding vote at the time such opportunity becomes official, whether to make or break a tie. If a verification of the vote is called for and granted, the decision of the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, to cast the deciding vote need not be made until the verification has been completed. In case of error in a vote, if the correction leaves decisive effect to the vote of the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, the deciding vote may be cast even though the result has been announced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. QUESTIONS OF ORDER. (a) The speaker shall decide on all questions of order; however, such decisions are subject to an appeal to the house made by any 10 members. Pending an appeal, the speaker shall call a member to the chair, who shall not have the authority to entertain or decide any other matter or proposition until the appeal has first been determined by the house. The question on appeal is, &quot;Shall the chair be sustained?&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No member shall speak more than once on an appeal unless given leave by a majority of the house. No motion shall be in order, pending an appeal, except a motion to adjourn, a motion to lay on the table, a motion for the previous question, or a motion for a call of the house. Responses to parliamentary inquiries and decisions of recognition made by the chair may not be appealed, except as provided by Rule 5, Section 24.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Further consideration of the matter or proposition that is the subject of a question of order is prohibited until the speaker decides the question of order and any appeal of that decision has been determined by the house. Consideration of any other matter or proposition is also prohibited while a question of order is pending, unless the question of order is temporarily withdrawn and the matter or proposition that is the subject of the question of order is postponed. Withdrawal of the question of order does not prevent any member from raising that question of order when the matter or proposition is again before the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) A point of order raised as to a violation of a section of the rules governing committee reports, committee minutes, or accompanying documentation may be overruled if the purpose of that section of the rules has been substantially fulfilled and the violation does not deceive or mislead.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) When a question of order is pending before the house, only the member who raised the question of order, and one other member designated by that member, and the primary proponent of the matter or proposition to which the question of order applies, and one other member designated by the proponent, may present arguments to the speaker or parliamentarian regarding the question of order. This subsection does not limit any remarks that a member may make before the full house if the member is recognized for that purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10.

EMERGENCY ADJOURNMENT. In the event of an emergency of such compelling nature that the speaker must adjourn the house without fixing a date and hour of reconvening, the speaker shall have authority to determine the date and hour of reconvening and to notify the members of the house by any means the speaker considers adequate. Should the speaker be disabled or otherwise unable to exercise these emergency powers, the permanent speaker pro tempore, if one has been named, shall have authority to act. If there is no permanent speaker pro tempore, or if that officer is unable to act, authority shall be exercised by the chair of the Committee on State Affairs, who shall preside until the house can proceed to the selection of a temporary presiding officer to function until the speaker or the speaker pro tempore is again able to exercise the duties and responsibilities of the office.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. POSTPONEMENT OF RECONVENING. When the house is not in session, if the speaker determines that it would be a hazard to the safety of the members, officers, employees, and others attending the legislature to reconvene at the time determined by the house at its last sitting, the speaker may clear the area of the capitol under the control of the house and postpone the reconvening of the house for a period of not more than 12 hours. On making that determination, the speaker shall order the sergeant-at-arms to post an assistant at each first floor entrance to the capitol and other places and advise all persons entering of the determination and the time set for the house to reconvene. The speaker shall also notify the journal clerk and the news media of the action, and the action shall be entered in the house journal.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13.

ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 14. CONTROL OVER HALL OF THE HOUSE. The speaker shall have general control, except as otherwise provided by law, of the hall of the house, its lobbies, galleries, corridors, and passages, and other rooms in those parts of the capitol assigned to the use of the house; except that the hall of the house shall not be used for any meeting other than legislative meetings during any regular or special session of the legislature unless specifically authorized by resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 15.

This provision shall have precedence over Rule 7, Section 20.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. ADVERSE REPORTS ON LOCAL BILLS.

The committee may impose a fee to cover the costs of issuing a pass card. This pass card must be presented to the doorkeeper each time the person seeks admission to the floor of the house while the house is in session. Pass cards issued under this section shall not be transferable. The failure of a media representative to maintain the requirements of this section may result in the revocation of the pass card. Persons admitted to the floor of the house pursuant to the provisions of this section shall work in appropriate convenient seats or work stations in the house, which shall be designated for that purpose by the Committee on House Administration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Members of the house shall not engage in interviews and press conferences on the house floor while the house is in session. The Committee on House Administration is authorized to enforce this provision and to prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary and desirable to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Permission to make recordings in or from the house chamber while the house is in session may be granted only by the Committee on House Administration.

Passes granted under this authority shall be subject to revocation by the Committee on House Administration. As used in this subsection, &quot;recording&quot; means an audio, video, or photographic recording for immediate or delayed transmission by television or radio or through the Internet.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The following individuals may submit a written complaint regarding a decision by the Committee on House Administration under this section:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) an individual who is aggrieved by the committee&#39;s failure or refusal to grant privileges under this section; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a member of the house who believes a media representative granted privileges under this section either does not meet the requirements of this section or has abused the privileges granted under this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) The Committee on House Administration shall investigate the complaint and may, if necessary, temporarily suspend the media representative&#39;s privileges pending the investigation. The committee shall notify the aggrieved individual or subject of the complaint of the time and place of a hearing on the complaint.

SPEAKING AND DEBATE</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. ADDRESSING THE HOUSE. When a member desires to speak or deliver any matter to the house, the member shall rise and respectfully address the speaker as &quot;Mr. (or Madam) Speaker&quot; and, on being recognized, may address the house from the microphone at the reading clerk&#39;s desk, and shall confine all remarks to the question under debate, avoiding personalities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. WHEN TWO MEMBERS RISE AT ONCE. When two or more members rise at once, the speaker shall name the one who is to speak first. This decision shall be final and not open to debate or appeal.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. RECOGNITION. (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, there shall be no appeal from the speaker&#39;s recognition, but the speaker shall be governed by rules and usage in priority of entertaining motions from the floor. When a member seeks recognition, the speaker may ask, &quot;For what purpose does the member rise?&quot; or &quot;For what purpose does the member seek recognition?&quot; and may then decide if recognition is to be granted, except that the speaker shall recognize a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If the speaker denies recognition of a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege, other than a question of privilege relating to the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker, the decision of recognition may be appealed using the procedures provided in Rule 1, Section 9.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) If the speaker denies recognition of a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege relating to the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker, the member may appeal the speaker&#39;s denial of recognition if the member submits to the speaker a written request, signed by at least 76 members of the house, to appeal the decision of recognition. Upon receiving a request for appeal in accordance with this subsection, the speaker shall announce the request to the house. The names of the members who signed the request and the time that the announcement was made shall be entered in the journal. The appeal of a decision of recognition under this subsection is eligible for consideration 24 hours after the request for appeal has been announced in accordance with this subsection. The appeal and consideration of the question of privilege, if the appeal is successful, takes precedence over all other questions except motions to adjourn.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. INTERRUPTION OF A MEMBER WHO HAS THE FLOOR. A member who has the floor shall not be interrupted by another member for any purpose, unless he or she consents to yield to the other member. A member desiring to interrupt another in debate should first address the speaker for the permission of the member speaking. The speaker shall then ask the member who has the floor if he or she wishes to yield, and then announce the decision of that member. The member who has the floor may exercise personal discretion as to whether or not to yield, and it is entirely within the member&#39;s discretion to determine who shall interrupt and when.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 26. YIELDING THE FLOOR. A member who obtains the floor on recognition of the speaker may not be taken off the floor by a motion, even the highly privileged motion to adjourn, but if the member yields to another to make a motion or to offer an amendment, he or she thereby loses the floor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 27. RIGHT TO OPEN AND CLOSE DEBATE. The mover of any proposition, or the member reporting any measure from a committee, or, in the absence of either of them, any other member designated by such absentee, shall have the right to open and close the debate, and for this purpose may speak each time not more than 20 minutes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 28. TIME LIMITS ON SPEECHES. All speeches shall be limited to 10 minutes in duration, except as provided in Section 27 of this rule, and the speaker shall call the members to order at the expiration of their time. If the house by a majority vote extends the time of any member, the extension shall be for 10 minutes only. A second extension of time shall be granted only by unanimous consent. During the last 10 calendar days of the regular session, and the last 5 calendar days of a special session, Sundays excepted, all speeches shall be limited to 10 minutes and shall not be extended. The time limits established by this rule shall include time consumed in yielding to questions from the floor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 29. LIMIT ON NUMBER OF TIMES TO SPEAK. No member shall speak more than twice on the same question without leave of the house, nor more than once until every member choosing to speak has spoken, nor shall any member be permitted to consume the time of another member without leave of the house being given by a majority vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 30. EFFECT OF ADJOURNMENT ON SPEAKING LIMIT. If a pending question is not disposed of because of an adjournment of the house, a member who has spoken twice on the subject shall not be allowed to speak again without leave of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. OBJECTION TO READING A PAPER. When the reading of a paper is called for, and objection is made, the matter shall be determined by a majority vote of the house, without debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 32. PASSING BETWEEN MICROPHONES DURING DEBATE. No person shall pass between the front and back microphones during debate or when a member has the floor and is addressing the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 33. TRANSGRESSION OF RULES WHILE SPEAKING. If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules of the house, the speaker shall, or any member may, call the member to order, in which case the member so called to order shall immediately be seated; however, that member may move for an appeal to the house, and if appeal is duly seconded by 10 members, the matter shall be submitted to the house for decision by majority vote. In such cases, the speaker shall not be required to relinquish the chair, as is required in cases of appeals from the speaker&#39;s decisions. The house shall, if appealed to, decide the matter without debate. If the decision is in favor of the member called to order, the member shall be at liberty to proceed; but if the decision is against the member, he or she shall not be allowed to proceed, and, if the case requires it, shall be liable to the censure of the house, or such other punishment as the house may consider proper.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 34. ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF ALL HOUSE PROCEEDINGS. (a) All proceedings of the house of representatives shall be electronically recorded under the direction of the Committee on House Administration. Copies of the proceedings may be released under guidelines promulgated by the Committee on House Administration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Archived video broadcasts of proceedings in the house chamber that are available through the house&#39;s Internet or intranet website may, under the direction of the Committee on House Administration, include a link to the point in time in the video where each measure under consideration by the house is laid out. Such a link shall be provided as soon as the committee determines is practical.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER D. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 35. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE DEFINED. Questions of privilege shall be:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) those affecting the rights of the house collectively, its safety and dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings, including the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of members individually in their representative capacity only.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 36. PRECEDENCE OF QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE. Questions of privilege shall have precedence over all other questions except motions to adjourn. When in order, a member may address the house on a question of privilege, or may at any time print it in the journal, provided it contains no reflection on any member of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 37. WHEN QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE NOT IN ORDER. (a) It shall not be in order for a member to address the house on a question of privilege:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) between the time an undebatable motion is offered and the vote is taken on the motion;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) between the time the previous question is ordered and the vote is taken on the last proposition included under the previous question; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) between the time a motion to table is offered and the vote is taken on the motion.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If a question of privilege relating to removal of the speaker and election of a new speaker fails, a subsequent attempt to remove the same speaker can be made only by reconsidering the vote by which the original question of privilege failed. Such reconsideration shall be subject to the rules of the house governing reconsideration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 38. CONFINING REMARKS TO QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE; INTERRUPTIONS PROHIBITED. (a) When speaking on privilege, members must confine their remarks within the limits of Section 35 of this rule, which will be strictly construed to achieve the purposes hereof.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When a member is speaking on privilege, the member shall not be interrupted by another member for any purpose. While the member is speaking, another member may submit a question of order to the speaker in writing or by approaching the podium in person. The member submitting the question of order shall not interrupt the member who is speaking. The speaker may interrupt the member who is speaking if the speaker determines it is appropriate to address the question of order at that time.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 39. DISCUSSION OF MERITS OF MOTION FORBIDDEN. Merits of a main or subsidiary motion shall not be discussed or debated under the guise of speaking to a question of privilege.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER E. VOTING</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 40. RECORDING ALL VOTES ON VOTING MACHINE. On all votes, except viva voce votes, members shall record their votes on the voting machine and shall not be recognized by the chair to cast their votes from the floor. If a member attempts to vote from the floor, the speaker shall sustain a point of order directed against the member&#39;s so doing. This rule shall not be applicable to the mover or the principal opponent of the proposition being voted on nor to a member whose voting machine is out of order. If a member demands strict enforcement of this section, Section 47 shall not apply to the taking of a vote, and the house may discipline a member in violation of this rule pursuant to its inherent authority.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 41. REGISTRATION EQUIVALENT TO ROLL CALL VOTE. A registration or vote taken on the voting machine of the house shall in all instances be considered the equivalent of a roll call or yea and nay vote, which might be had for the same purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 42. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL OR PRIVATE INTEREST. Any member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill proposed or pending before the house shall disclose the fact and not vote thereon.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 43. DIVIDING THE QUESTION. By a majority vote of the house, a quorum being present, the question shall be divided, if it includes propositions so distinct in substance that, one being taken away, a substantive proposition remains. A motion for a division vote cannot be made after the previous question has been ordered, after a motion to table has been offered, after the question has been put, nor after the yeas and nays have been ordered. Under this subsection, the speaker may divide the question into groups of propositions that are closely related.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 44. FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO VOTE. Any member who is present and fails or refuses to vote after being requested to do so by the speaker shall be recorded as present but not voting, and shall be counted for the purpose of making a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 45. PRESENCE IN HOUSE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO VOTE. A member must be on the floor of the house or in an adjacent room or hallway on the same level as the house floor, in order to vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 46. LOCKING VOTING MACHINES OF ABSENT MEMBERS. During each calendar day in which the house is in session, it shall be the duty of the journal clerk to lock the voting machine of each member who is excused or who is otherwise known to be absent. Each such machine shall remain locked until the member in person contacts the journal clerk and personally requests the unlocking of the machine. Unless otherwise directed by the speaker, the journal clerk shall not unlock any machine except at the personal request of the member to whom the machine is assigned. Any violation, or any attempt by a member or employee to circumvent the letter or spirit of this section, shall be reported immediately to the speaker for such disciplinary action by the speaker, or by the house, as may be warranted under the circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 47. VOTING FOR ANOTHER MEMBER. Any member found guilty by the house of knowingly voting for another member on the voting machine without that other member&#39;s permission shall be subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 48. INTERRUPTION OF A ROLL CALL. Once a roll call has begun, it may not be interrupted for any reason. While a yea and nay vote is being taken, or the vote is being counted, no member shall visit the reading clerk&#39;s desk or the voting clerk&#39;s desk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 49. EXPLANATION OF VOTE. (a) No member shall be allowed to interrupt the vote or to make any explanation of a vote that the member is about to give after the voting machine has been opened, but may record in the journal the reasons for giving such a vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; must be in writing and filed with the journal clerk. If timely received, the &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; shall be printed immediately following the results of the vote in the journal. Otherwise, &quot;Reasons for Vote&quot; shall be printed in a separate section at the end of the journal for the day on which the reasons were recorded with the journal clerk. Such &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; shall not deal in personalities or contain any personal reflection on any member of the legislature, the speaker, the lieutenant governor, or the governor, and shall not in any other manner transgress the rules of the house relating to decorum and debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A member absent when a vote was taken may file with the journal clerk while the house is in session a statement of how the member would have voted if present. If timely received, the statement shall be printed immediately following the results of the vote in the journal. Otherwise, statements shall be printed in a separate section at the end of the journal for the day on which the statements were recorded with the journal clerk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 50. PAIRS. (a) All pairs must be announced before the vote is declared by the speaker, and a written statement sent to the journal clerk. The statement must be signed by the absent member to the pair, or the member&#39;s signature must have been authorized in writing or by telephone, and satisfactory evidence presented to the speaker if deemed necessary. If authorized in writing, the writing shall be delivered to the chief clerk by personal delivery or by commercially acceptable means of delivery, including electronic transmission by PDF or similar secure format that is capable of transmitting an accurate image of the member&#39;s signature. If authorized by telephone, the call must be to and confirmed by the chief clerk in advance of the vote to which it applies. Pairs shall be entered in the journal, and the member present shall be counted to make a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The speaker may not refuse to recognize a pair that complies with the requirements of Subsection (a), if both members consent to the pair.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 51. ENTRY OF YEA AND NAY VOTE IN JOURNAL. (a) At the desire of any member present, the yeas and nays of the members of the house on any question shall be taken and entered in the journal. No member or members shall be allowed to call for a yea and nay vote after a vote has been declared by the speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to expunge a yea and nay vote from the journal shall not be in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The yeas and nays of the members of the house on final passage of any bill, any joint resolution proposing or ratifying a constitutional amendment, and any other resolution, other than a resolution of a purely ceremonial or honorary nature, shall be taken and entered in the journal. For purposes of this subsection, a vote on final passage includes a vote on:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) third reading;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) second reading if the house suspends or otherwise dispenses with the requirement for three readings;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) whether to concur in the senate&#39;s amendments; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) whether to adopt a conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 51A. REAL-TIME ACCESS BY PUBLIC TO YEAS AND NAYS. The Committee on House Administration shall ensure that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the recorded yeas and nays are available to the public on the Internet and on any televised broadcast of the house proceedings produced by or under the direction of the house; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) members of the public may view the yeas and nays in real time to the extent possible on the Internet and on any televised broadcast of the house proceedings produced by or under the direction of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 52. JOURNAL RECORDING OF VOTES ON ANY QUESTION. On any question where a record of the yeas and nays has not been ordered, members may have their votes recorded in the journal as &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; by filing such information with the journal clerk before adjournment or recess to another calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 53. CHANGING A VOTE. Before the result of a vote has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the chair, but not thereafter, a member may change his or her vote; however, if a member&#39;s vote is erroneous, the member shall be allowed to change that vote at a later time provided:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the result of the record vote is not changed thereby;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the request is made known to the house by the chair and permission for the change is granted by unanimous consent; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a notation is made in the journal that the member&#39;s vote was changed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 54. TIE VOTE. All matters on which a vote may be taken by the house shall require for adoption a favorable affirmative vote as required by these rules, and in the case of a tie vote, the matter shall be considered lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 55. VERIFICATION OF A YEA AND NAY VOTE. When the result of a yea and nay vote is close, the speaker may on the request of any member order a verification vote, or the speaker may order a verification on his or her own initiative. During verification, no member shall change a vote unless it was erroneously recorded, nor may any member not having voted cast a vote; however, when the clerk errs in reporting the yeas and nays, and correction thereof leaves decisive effect to the speaker&#39;s vote, the speaker may exercise the right to vote, even though the result has been announced. A verification shall be called for immediately after the vote is announced. The speaker shall not entertain a request for verification after the house has proceeded to the next question, or after a recess or an adjournment. A vote to recess or adjourn, like any other proposition, may be verified. Only one vote verification can be pending at a time. A verification may be dispensed with by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 56. VERIFICATION OF A REGISTRATION. The speaker may allow the verification of a registration (as differentiated from a record vote) if in the speaker&#39;s opinion there is serious doubt as to the presence of a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 57. MOTION FOR A CALL OF THE HOUSE PENDING VERIFICATION. A motion for a call of the house, and all incidental motions relating to it, shall be in order pending the verification of a vote. These motions must be made before the roll call on verification begins, and it shall not be in order to break into the roll call to make them.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 58. ERRONEOUS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULT OF A VOTE. If, by an error of the voting clerk or reading clerk in reporting the yeas and nays from a registration or verification, the speaker announces a result different from that shown by the registration or verification, the status of the question shall be determined by the vote as actually recorded. If the vote is erroneously announced in such a way as to change the true result, all subsequent proceedings in connection therewith shall fail, and the journal shall be amended accordingly.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 6. ORDER OF BUSINESS AND CALENDARS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. DAILY ORDER OF BUSINESS. (a) When the house convenes on a new legislative day, the daily order of business shall be as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Call to order by speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Registration of members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Prayer by chaplain, unless the invocation has been given previously on the particular calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Pledge of allegiance to the United States flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) Excuses for absence of members and officers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) First reading and reference to committee of bills filed with the chief clerk; and motions to introduce bills, when such motions are required.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) Requests to print bills and other papers; requests of committees for further time to consider papers referred to them; and all other routine motions and business not otherwise provided for, all of which shall be undebatable except that the mover and one opponent of the motion shall be allowed three minutes each.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The mover of a routine motion shall be allowed his or her choice of making the opening or the closing speech under this rule. If the house, under a suspension of the rules, extends the time of a member under this rule, such extensions shall be for three minutes. Subsidiary motions that are applicable to routine motions shall be in order, but the makers of such subsidiary motions shall not be entitled to speak thereon in the routine motion period, nor shall the authors of the original routine motions be allowed any additional time because of subsidiary motions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) Unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10) Third reading calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) Postponed matters to be laid before the house in accordance with Rule 7, Section 15.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(12) Second reading calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When the house reconvenes for the first time on a new calendar day following a recess, the daily order of business shall be:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Call to order by the speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Registration of members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Prayer by the chaplain.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Pledge of allegiance to the United States flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) Excuses for absence of members and officers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) Pending business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) Calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. SPECIAL ORDERS. (a) Any bill, resolution, or other measure may on any day be made a special order for the same day or for a future day of the session by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present. A motion to set a special order shall be subject to the three-minute pro and con debate rule. When once established as a special order, a bill, resolution, or other measure shall be considered from day to day until disposed of; and until it has been disposed of, no further special orders shall be made.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A three-fourths vote of the members present shall be required to suspend the portion of this rule which specifies that only one special order may be made and pending at a time.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first eight items under the daily order of business for a legislative day have been passed, a special order shall have precedence when the hour for its consideration has arrived, except as provided in Section 9 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) After the 115th day of a regular session, if a joint resolution has appeared on a daily house calendar and is adopted, and a bill that is enabling legislation for the joint resolution is either on or eligible to be placed on a calendar, the author or sponsor of the bill or another member may immediately be recognized for a motion to set the bill that is the enabling legislation as a special order pursuant to this section. For purposes of this subsection, the bill must have been designated as the enabling legislation for the joint resolution in writing filed with the chief clerk not later than the date the committee report for the enabling legislation is printed and distributed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL ORDER. A special order may be postponed to a day certain by a two-thirds vote of those present, and when so postponed, shall be considered as disposed of so far as its place as a special order is concerned.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. TABLED MEASURES AS SPECIAL ORDERS. A bill or resolution laid on the table subject to call may be made a special order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. SUBSTITUTION IN MOTION FOR A SPECIAL ORDER. When a motion is pending to set a particular bill or resolution as a special order, it shall not be in order to move as a substitute to set another bill or resolution as a special order. It shall be in order, however, to substitute, by majority vote, a different time for the special order consideration than that given in the original motion.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. MEMBER&#39;S SUSPENSION AND SPECIAL ORDER PRIVILEGES. If a member moves to set a bill or joint resolution as a special order, or moves to suspend the rules to take up a bill or joint resolution out of its regular order, and the motion prevails, the member shall not have the right to make either of these motions again until every other member has had an opportunity, via either of these motions, to have some bill or joint resolution considered out of its regular order during that session of the legislature. A member shall not lose the suspension privilege if the motion to suspend or set for special order does not prevail.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. SYSTEM OF CALENDARS. (a) Legislative business of the house shall be controlled by a system of calendars, consisting of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) EMERGENCY CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills considered to be of such pressing and imperative import as to demand immediate action, bills to raise revenue and levy taxes, and the general appropriations bill. A bill submitted as an emergency matter by the governor may also be placed on this calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) MAJOR STATE CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills of statewide effect, not emergency in nature, which establish or change state policy in a major field of governmental activity and which will have a major impact in application throughout the state without regard to class, area, or other limiting factors.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS CALENDAR, on which shall appear joint resolutions proposing amendments to the Texas Constitution, joint resolutions proposing the ratification of amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and joint resolutions applying to Congress for a convention to amend the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) GENERAL STATE CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills of statewide effect, not emergency in nature, which establish or change state law and which have application to all areas but are limited in legal effect by classification or other factors which minimize the impact to something less than major state policy, and bills, not emergency in nature, which are not on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills, house resolutions, and concurrent resolutions, not emergency in nature, regardless of extent and scope, on which there is such general agreement as to render improbable any opposition to the consideration and passage thereof, and which have been recommended by the appropriate standing committee for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear house resolutions and concurrent resolutions, not emergency in nature and not privileged.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear congratulatory and memorial resolutions whose sole intent is to congratulate, memorialize, or otherwise express concern or commendation. The Committee on Resolutions Calendars may provide separate categories for congratulatory and memorial resolutions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A calendars committee shall strictly construe and the speaker shall strictly enforce this system of calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. SENATE BILL CALENDARS. (a) Senate bills and resolutions pending in the house shall follow the same procedure with regard to calendars as house bills and resolutions, but separate calendars shall be maintained for senate bills and resolutions, and consideration of them on senate bill days shall have priority in the manner and order specified in this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No other business shall be considered on days devoted to the consideration of senate bills when there remain any bills on any of the senate calendars, except with the consent of the senate. When all senate calendars are clear, the house may proceed to consideration of house calendars on senate bill days.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. SENATE BILL DAYS. (a) On calendar Wednesday and on calendar Thursday of each week, only senate bills and senate resolutions shall be taken up and considered, until disposed of. Senate bills and senate resolutions shall be considered in the order prescribed in Section 7 of this rule on separate senate calendars prepared by the Committee on Calendars. In case a senate bill or senate resolution is pending at adjournment on calendar Thursday, it shall go over to the succeeding calendar Wednesday as unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Precedence given in Rule 8 to certain classes of bills during the first 60 calendar days of a regular session shall also apply to senate bills on senate bill days.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10. CONSIDERATION OF SENATE BILL ON SAME SUBJECT. When any house bill is reached on the calendar or is before the house for consideration, it shall be the duty of the speaker to give the place on the calendar of the house bill to any senate bill containing the same subject that has been referred to and reported from a committee of the house and to lay the senate bill before the house, to be considered in lieu of the house bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11. PERIODS FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL CALENDARS. As the volume of legislation shall warrant, the chair of the Committee on Resolutions Calendars shall move to designate periods for the consideration of congratulatory and memorial calendars. Each such motion shall require a two-thirds vote for its adoption. In each instance, the Committee on Resolutions Calendars shall prepare and post on the electronic legislative information system a calendar at least 24 hours in advance of the hour set for consideration. No memorial or congratulatory resolution will be heard by the full house without having first been approved, at least 24 hours in advance, by a majority of the membership of the Committee on Resolutions Calendars, in accordance with Rule 4, Section 16. It shall not be necessary for the Committee on Resolutions Calendars to report a memorial or congratulatory resolution from committee in order to place the resolution on a congratulatory and memorial calendar. If the Committee on Resolutions Calendars determines that a resolution is not eligible for placement on the congratulatory and memorial calendar the measure shall be sent to the Committee on Calendars for further action. A congratulatory and memorial calendar will contain the resolution number, the author&#39;s name, and a brief description of the intent of the resolution. On the congratulatory and memorial calendar, congratulatory resolutions may be listed separately from memorial resolutions. Once a calendar is posted, no additional resolutions will be added to it, and the requirements of this section shall not be subject to suspension.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL CALENDARS. During the consideration of a congratulatory and memorial calendar, resolutions shall not be read in full unless they pertain to members or former members of the legislature, or unless the intended recipient of the resolution is present on the house floor or in the gallery. All other such resolutions shall be read only by number, type of resolution, and name of the person or persons designated in the resolutions. Members shall notify the chair, in advance of consideration of the calendar, of any resolutions that will be required to be read in full. In addition, the following procedures shall be observed:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) The chair shall recognize the reading clerk to read the resolutions within each category on the calendar only by number, type of resolution, author or sponsor, and name of the person or persons designated in the resolutions, except for those resolutions that have been withdrawn or that are required to be read in full. The resolutions read by the clerk shall then be adopted in one motion for each category.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Subsequent to the adoption of the resolutions read by the clerk, the chair shall proceed to lay before the house the resolutions on the calendar that are required to be read in full. Each such resolution shall be read and adopted individually.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If it develops that any resolution on the congratulatory and memorial calendar does not belong on that calendar, the chair shall withdraw the resolution from further consideration, remove it from the calendar, and refer it to the appropriate calendars committee for placement on the proper calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. PERIODS FOR CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDARS. (a) As the volume of legislation shall warrant, the chair of the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall move to designate periods for the consideration of local, consent, and resolutions calendars. Each such motion shall require a two-thirds vote for its adoption. In each instance, the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall prepare and post on the electronic legislative information system a calendar at least 48 hours in advance of the hour set for consideration. Once a calendar is posted, no additional bills or resolutions will be added to it. This requirement can be suspended only by unanimous consent. No local, consent, and resolutions calendar may be considered by the house if it is determined that the rules of the house were not complied with by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars in preparing that calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The period designated for the consideration of a local, consent, and resolutions calendar under this section or under a special order under Section 2 of this rule may not exceed one calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 14. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDARS. During the consideration of a local, consent, and resolutions calendar set by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars the following procedures shall be observed:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) The chair shall allow the sponsor of each bill or resolution three minutes to explain the measure, and the time shall not be extended except by unanimous consent of the house. This rule shall have precedence over all other rules limiting time for debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If it develops that any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar is to be contested on the floor of the house under Subdivision (3) or (4) of this section, the chair shall withdraw the bill or resolution from further consideration and remove it from the calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar shall be considered contested if notice is given by five or more members present in the house under Rule 5, Section 45, that they intend to oppose the bill or resolution, either by a raising of hands or the delivery of written notice to the chair.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar shall be considered contested if debate exceeds 10 minutes, after the chair lays out the bill or resolution following the sponsor&#39;s explanation under Subdivision (1) of this section. The chair shall strictly enforce this time limit and automatically withdraw the bill from further consideration if the time limit herein imposed is exceeded.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar that is not reached for floor consideration because of the expiration of the calendar day period for consideration established by Section 13 of this rule shall carry over onto the next local, consent, and resolutions calendar. Bills or resolutions that carry over must appear in the same relative order as on the calendar on which the bills or resolutions initially appeared, and bills or resolutions originally from older calendars must appear before those originally from more recent calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) A motion to postpone a bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar to a subsequent legislative or calendar day requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 15. ORDER OF CONSIDERATION OF CALENDARS. Except for local, consent, and resolutions calendars and congratulatory and memorial calendars, consideration of calendars shall be in the order named in Section 7 of this rule, subject to any exceptions ordered by the Committee on Calendars. Bills and resolutions on third reading shall have precedence over bills and resolutions on second reading.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 16. DAILY CALENDARS, SUPPLEMENTAL CALENDARS, AND LISTS OF ITEMS ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION. (a) Calendars shall be prepared daily when the house is in session. A calendar must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least 36 hours if convened in regular session and 24 hours if convened in special session before the calendar may be considered by the house, except as otherwise provided by these rules for the calendar on which the general appropriations bill is first eligible for consideration on second reading when convened in regular session. A calendar that contains a bill extending an agency, commission, or advisory committee under the Texas Sunset Act must be posted at least 48 hours if convened in regular or special session before the calendar may be considered by the house. Deviations from the calendars as posted shall not be permitted except that the Committee on Calendars shall be authorized to prepare and post, not later than two hours before the house convenes, a supplemental daily house calendar, on which shall appear:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) bills or resolutions which were passed to third reading on the previous legislative day, except as provided by Section 24(b) of this rule;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) bills or resolutions which appeared on the Daily House Calendar for a previous calendar day which were not reached for floor consideration;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) postponed business from a previous calendar day; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) notice to take from the table a bill or resolution which was laid on the table subject to call on a previous legislative day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the items listed above, the bills and resolutions from a daily house calendar that will be eligible for consideration may be incorporated, in their proper order as determined by these rules, into the supplemental daily house calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a-1) If the house is convened in regular session, the calendar on which the general appropriations bill is first eligible for consideration on second reading must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least 144 hours before the calendar may be considered by the house. The posted calendar must indicate the date and time at which the calendar is scheduled for consideration by the house, which date and time must be in accordance with Rule 8, Section 14.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) In addition, when the volume of legislation shall warrant, and upon request of the speaker, the chief clerk shall have prepared a list of Items Eligible for Consideration, on which shall appear only:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) house bills with senate amendments that are eligible for consideration under Rule 13, Section 5, including the number of senate amendments and the total number of pages of senate amendments;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) senate bills for which the senate has requested appointment of a conference committee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) conference committee reports that are eligible for consideration under Rule 13, Section 10.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The list of Items Eligible for Consideration must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least six hours before the list may be considered by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The time at which a calendar or list is posted on the electronic legislative information system shall be time-stamped on the originals of the calendar or list.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) No house calendar shall be eligible for consideration if it is determined that the rules of the house were not complied with by the Committee on Calendars in preparing that calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) If the Committee on Calendars has proposed a rule for floor consideration of a bill or resolution that is eligible to be placed on a calendar of the daily house calendar, the rule must be printed and a copy distributed to each member. If the bill or resolution to which the rule will apply has already been placed on a calendar of the daily house calendar, a copy of the rule must also be posted with the calendar on which the bill or resolution appears. The speaker shall lay a proposed rule before the house prior to the consideration of the bill or resolution to which the rule will apply. The rule shall be laid before the house not earlier than six hours after a copy of the rule has been distributed to each member in accordance with this subsection. The rule shall not be subject to amendment, but to be effective, the rule must be approved by the house by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of those members present and voting, except that the rule must be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of those members present and voting if the rule applies to a tax bill, an appropriations bill, or a redistricting bill. If approved by the house in accordance with this subsection, the rule will be effective for the consideration of the bill or resolution on both second and third readings.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. POSITION ON A CALENDAR. (a) Unless removed from the calendar under Subsection (b) of this section, once a bill or resolution is placed on its appropriate calendar under these rules, and has appeared on a house calendar, as posted on the electronic legislative information system, the bill shall retain its relative position on the calendar until reached for floor consideration, and the calendars committee with jurisdiction over the bill or resolution shall have no authority to place other bills on the calendar ahead of that bill, but all additions to the calendar shall appear subsequent to the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If a bill or resolution that has been placed on a house calendar, as posted on the electronic legislative information system, is recommitted or withdrawn from further consideration, the bill or resolution relinquishes its position on the calendar, and the bill or resolution shall be removed from the calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 18. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLACEMENT ON A CALENDAR. Except as provided in Section 11 of this rule as it relates to congratulatory and memorial resolutions, no bill or resolution shall be placed on a calendar until:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) it has been referred to and reported from its appropriate standing committee by favorable committee action; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) it is ordered printed on minority report or after a committee has reported its inability to recommend a course of action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 19. REFERRAL TO CALENDARS COMMITTEES. All bills and resolutions, on being reported from committee, shall be referred immediately to the committee coordinator for printing and then to the appropriate calendars committee for placement on the appropriate calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 20. TIME LIMIT FOR VOTE TO PLACE ON A CALENDAR. Within 30 calendar days after a bill or resolution has been referred to the appropriate calendars committee, the committee must vote on whether to place the bill or resolution on one of the calendars of the daily house calendar or the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, as applicable. A vote against placement of the bill or resolution on a calendar does not preclude a calendars committee from later voting in favor of placement of the bill or resolution on a calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 21. MOTION TO PLACE ON A CALENDAR. (a) When a bill or resolution has been in the appropriate calendars committee for 30 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, awaiting placement on one of the calendars of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, it shall be in order for a member to move that the bill or resolution be placed on a specific calendar of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar without action by the committee. This motion must be seconded by five members and shall require a majority vote for adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to place a bill or resolution on a specific calendar of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. REQUEST FOR PLACEMENT ON LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR. No bill or resolution shall be considered for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars unless a request for that placement has been made to the chair of the standing committee from which the bill or resolution was reported and unless the committee report of the standing committee recommends that the bill or resolution be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar. The recommendation of the standing committee shall be advisory only, and the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall have final authority to determine whether or not a bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar. If the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars determines that the bill or resolution is not eligible for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, the measure shall be sent to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. QUALIFICATIONS FOR PLACEMENT ON THE LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR. (a) No bill defined as a local bill by Rule 8, Section 10(c), shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar unless:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) evidence of publication of notice in compliance with the Texas Constitution and these rules is filed with the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) it has been recommended unanimously by the present and voting members of the committee from which it was reported that the bill be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No other bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar unless it has been recommended unanimously by the present and voting members of the committee from which it was reported that the bill be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) No bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) directly or indirectly prevents from being available for purposes of funding state government generally any money that under existing law would otherwise be available for that purpose, including a bill that transfers or diverts money in the state treasury from the general revenue fund to another fund; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) authorizes or requires the expenditure or diversion of state funds for any purpose, as determined by a fiscal note attached to the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. REPLACEMENT OF CONTESTED BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS. (a) A bill on second reading or a resolution once removed from the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by being contested on the floor of the house under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule shall be returned to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for further action. The Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, if it feels such action is warranted, may again place the bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, provided, however, that if the bill or resolution is not placed on the next local, consent, and resolutions calendar set by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, the bill or resolution shall immediately be referred to the Committee on Calendars for further action. If a bill on second reading or a resolution is then removed from the calendar a second time by being contested on the floor of the house under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule, the bill or resolution shall not again be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars during that session of the legislature but shall be returned to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A bill on third reading removed from the local, consent, and resolutions calendar under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule shall appear on the supplemental daily house calendar for the next legislative day for which a supplemental daily house calendar has not already been distributed, pursuant to Section 16(a)(1) of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) This section does not apply to a bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar that is withdrawn from the calendar at the request of the author or sponsor without being contested under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule. A bill or resolution withdrawn under this subsection shall be returned to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for further action. The Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, if it feels such action is warranted, may again place the bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar or refer the bill or resolution to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. DISCRETION IN PLACEMENT ON CALENDARS. Subject to the limitations contained in this rule, the Committee on Calendars shall have full authority to make placements on calendars in whatever order is necessary and desirable under the circumstances then existing, except that bills on third reading shall have precedence over bills on second reading. It is the intent of the calendar system to give the Committee on Calendars wide discretion to insure adequate consideration by the house of important legislation.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 7.

ADJOURNING WITH LESS THAN A QUORUM. A smaller number of members than a quorum may adjourn from day to day, and may compel the attendance of absent members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. MOTION TO TABLE. A motion to lay on the table, if carried, shall have the effect of killing the bill, resolution, amendment, or other immediate proposition to which it was applied. Such a motion shall not be debatable, but the mover of the proposition to be tabled, or the member reporting it from committee, shall be allowed to close the debate after the motion to table is made and before it is put to a vote. When a motion to table is made to a debatable main motion, the main motion mover shall be allowed 20 minutes to close the debate, whereas the movers of other debatable motions sought to be tabled shall be allowed only 10 minutes to close. The vote by which a motion to table is carried or lost cannot be reconsidered. After the previous question has been ordered, a motion to table is not in order. The provisions of this section do not apply to motions to &quot;lay on the table subject to call&quot;; however, a motion to lay on the table subject to call cannot be made after the previous question has been ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. MATTERS TABLED SUBJECT TO CALL. When a bill, resolution, or other matter is pending before the house, it may be laid on the table subject to call, and one legislative day&#39;s notice, as provided on the Supplemental House Calendar, must be given before the proposition can be taken from the table, unless it is on the same legislative day, in which case it can be taken from the table at any time except when there is another matter pending before the house. A bill, resolution, or other matter can be taken from the table only by a majority vote of the house. When a special order is pending, a motion to take a proposition from the table cannot be made unless the proposition is a privileged matter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 14. MOTION TO POSTPONE. (a) A motion to postpone to a day certain may be amended and is debatable within narrow limits, but the merits of the proposition sought to be postponed cannot be debated. A motion to postpone indefinitely opens to debate the entire proposition to which it applies.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to postpone a bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar to a subsequent legislative or calendar day requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 15. POSTPONED MATTERS. A bill or proposition postponed to a day certain shall be laid before the house at the time on the calendar day to which it was postponed, provided it is otherwise eligible under the rules and no other business is then pending. If business is pending, the postponed matter shall be deferred until the pending business is disposed of without prejudice otherwise to its right of priority. When a privileged matter is postponed to a particular time, and that time arrives, the matter, still retaining its privileged nature, shall be taken up even though another matter is pending.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 16. ORDER OF CONSIDERATION OF POSTPONED MATTERS. If two or more bills, resolutions, or other propositions are postponed to the same time, and are otherwise eligible for consideration at that time, they shall be considered in the chronological order of their setting.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. MOTION TO REFER. When motions are made to refer a subject to a select or standing committee, the question on the subject&#39;s referral to a standing committee shall be put first.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 18. MOTION TO RECOMMIT. A motion to recommit a bill, after being defeated at the routine motion period, may again be made when the bill itself is under consideration; however, a motion to recommit a bill shall not be in order at the routine motion period if the bill is then before the house as either pending business or unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A motion to recommit a bill or resolution can be made and voted on even though the author, sponsor, or principal proponent is not present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 19. TERMS OF DEBATE ON MOTIONS TO REFER, REREFER, COMMIT, OR RECOMMIT. A motion to refer, rerefer, commit, or recommit is debatable within narrow limits, but the merits of the proposition may not be brought into the debate. A motion to refer, rerefer, commit, or recommit with instructions is fully debatable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 20. RECOMMITTING TO COMMITTEE FOR A SECOND TIME. Except as provided in Rule 4, Section 30, when a bill has been recommitted once at any reading and has been reported adversely by the committee to which it was referred, it shall be in order to again recommit the bill only if a minority report has been filed in the time required by the rules of the house. A two-thirds vote of those present shall be required to recommit a second time.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER B. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 21. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. There shall be a motion for the previous question, which shall be admitted only when seconded by 25 members. It shall be put by the chair in this manner: &quot;The motion has been seconded. Three minutes pro and con debate will be allowed on the motion for ordering the previous question.&quot; As soon as the debate has ended, the chair shall continue: &quot;As many as are in favor of ordering the previous question on (here state on which question or questions) will say &#39;Aye,&#39;&quot; and then, &quot;As many as are opposed say &#39;Nay.&#39;&quot; As in all other propositions, a motion for the previous question may be taken by a record vote if demanded by any member. If ordered by a majority of the members voting, a quorum being present, it shall have the effect of cutting off all debate, except as provided in Section 23 of this rule, and bringing the house to a direct vote on the immediate question or questions on which it has been asked and ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. DEBATE ON MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION. On the motion for the previous question, there shall be no debate except as provided in Sections 2 and 21 of this rule. All incidental questions of order made pending decision on such motion shall be decided, whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. LIMITATION OF DEBATE AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. After the previous question has been ordered, there shall be no debate upon the questions on which it has been ordered, or upon the incidental questions, except that the mover of the proposition or any of the pending amendments or any other motions, or the member making the report from the committee, or, in the case of the absence of either of them, any other member designated by such absentee, shall have the right to close the debate on the particular proposition or amendment. Then a vote shall be taken immediately on the amendments or other motions, if any, and then on the main question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. SPEAKING AND VOTING AFTER THE PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. All members having the right to speak after the previous question has been ordered shall speak before the question is put on the first proposition covered by the previous question. All votes shall then be taken in the correct order, and no vote or votes shall be deferred to allow any member to close on any one of the propositions separately after the voting has commenced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. SPEAKING ON AN AMENDMENT AS SUBSTITUTED. When an amendment has been substituted and the previous question is then moved on the adoption of the amendment as substituted, the author of the amendment as substituted shall have the right to close the debate on that amendment in lieu of the author of the original amendment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 26. SPEAKING ON A MOTION TO POSTPONE OR AMEND. When the previous question is ordered on a motion to postpone indefinitely or to amend by striking out the enacting clause of a bill, the member moving to postpone or amend shall have the right to close the debate on that motion or amendment, after which the mover of the proposition or bill proposed to be so postponed or amended, or the member reporting it from the committee, or, in the absence of either of them, any other member designated by the absentee, shall be allowed to close the debate on the original proposition.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 27. APPLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. The previous question may be asked and ordered on any debatable single motion or series of motions, or any amendment or amendments pending, or it may be made to embrace all authorized debatable motions or amendments pending and include the bill, resolution, or proposition that is on second or third reading. The previous question cannot be ordered, however, on the main proposition without including other pending motions of lower rank as given in Section 3 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 28. LIMIT OF APPLICATION. The previous question shall not extend beyond the final vote on a motion or sequence of motions to which the previous question has been ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 29. AMENDMENTS NOT YET LAID BEFORE THE HOUSE. Amendments on the speaker&#39;s desk for consideration which have not actually been laid before the house and read cannot be included under a motion for the previous question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 30. MOVING THE PREVIOUS QUESTION AFTER A MOTION TO TABLE. If a motion to table is made directly to a main motion, the motion for the previous question is not in order. In a case where an amendment to a main motion is pending, and a motion to table the amendment is made, it is in order to move the previous question on the main motion, the pending amendment, and the motion to table the amendment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. NO SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. There is no acceptable substitute for a motion for the previous question, nor can other motions be applied to it.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 32. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION NOT SUBJECT TO TABLING. The motion for the previous question is not subject to a motion to table.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 33. MOTION TO ADJOURN AFTER MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION ACCEPTED. The motion to adjourn is not in order after a motion for the previous question is accepted by the chair, or after the seconding of such motion and before a vote is taken.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 34. MOTIONS IN ORDER AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. After the previous question has been ordered, no motion shall be in order until the question or questions on which it was ordered have been voted on, without debate, except:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a motion for a call of the house, and motions incidental thereto;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a motion to extend the time of a member closing on a proposition;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a motion to permit a member who has the right to speak to yield the time or a part thereof to another member;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) a request for and a verification of a vote;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a motion to reconsider the vote by which the previous question was ordered. A motion to reconsider may be made only once and that must be before any vote under the previous question has been taken;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) a motion to table a motion to reconsider the vote by which the previous question has been ordered;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) a double motion to reconsider and table the vote by which the previous question was ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 35. MOTION TO ADJOURN OR RECESS AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. No motion for an adjournment or a recess shall be in order after the previous question is ordered until the final vote under the previous question has been taken, unless the roll call shows the absence of a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 36. ADJOURNING WITHOUT A QUORUM. When the house adjourns without a quorum under the previous question, the previous question shall remain in force and effect when the bill, resolution, or other proposition is again laid before the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER C. RECONSIDERATION</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 37. MOTION TO RECONSIDER A VOTE. (a) When a question has been decided by the house and the yeas and nays have been called for and recorded, any member voting with the prevailing side may, on the same legislative day, or on the next legislative day, move a reconsideration; however, if a reconsideration is moved on the next legislative day, it must be done before the order of the day, as designated in the 10th item of Rule 6, Section 1(a), is taken up. If the house refuses to reconsider, or on reconsideration, affirms its decision, no further action to reconsider shall be in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Where the yeas and nays have not been called for and recorded, any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, may make the motion to reconsider; however, even when the yeas and nays have not been recorded, the following shall not be eligible to make a motion to reconsider:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a member who was absent;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a member who was paired and, therefore, did not vote; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a member who was recorded in the journal as having voted on the losing side.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, a motion to reconsider the vote by which a bill, joint resolution, or concurrent resolution was defeated is not in order unless a member has previously provided at least one hour&#39;s notice of intent to make the motion by addressing the house when the house is in session and stating that a member intends to make a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill or resolution was defeated. It is not necessary for the member providing the notice to be eligible to make or to be the member who subsequently makes the motion to reconsider. If notice of intent to make a motion to reconsider is given within the period that the motion to reconsider may be made under Subsection (a) of this section and that period expires during the one-hour period required by this subsection, then the period within which the motion may be made under Subsection (a) is extended by the amount of time, not to exceed one hour during which the house is in session, necessary to satisfy the one-hour notice required by this subsection. This subsection does not apply to a motion to reconsider and table or to a motion to reconsider and spread on the journal, if no business has been transacted after the defeat of the measure.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 38. DEBATE ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider shall be debatable only when the question to be reconsidered is debatable. Even though the previous question was in force before the vote on a debatable question was taken, debate is permissible on the reconsideration of such debatable question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 39. MAJORITY VOTE REQUIRED. Every motion to reconsider shall be decided by a majority vote, even though the vote on the original question requires a two-thirds vote for affirmative action. If the motion to reconsider prevails, the question then immediately recurs on the question reconsidered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 40. WITHDRAWAL OF MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider cannot be withdrawn unless permission is given by a majority vote of the house, and the motion may be called up by any member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 41. TABLING MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider shall be subject to a motion to table, which, if carried, shall be a final disposition of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 42. DOUBLE MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND TABLE. The double motion to reconsider and table shall be in order. It shall be undebatable. When carried, the motion to reconsider shall be tabled. When it fails, the question shall then be on the motion to reconsider, and the motion to reconsider shall, without further action, be spread on the journal, but it may be called up by any member, in accordance with the provisions of Section 43 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 43. DELAYED DISPOSITION OF MOTION TO RECONSIDER. (a) If a motion to reconsider is not disposed of when made, it shall be entered in the journal, and cannot, after that legislative day, be called up and disposed of unless one legislative day&#39;s notice has been given.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Unless called up and disposed of prior to 72 hours before final adjournment of the session, all motions to reconsider shall be regarded as determined and lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) All motions to reconsider made during the last 72 hours of the session shall be disposed of when made; otherwise, the motion shall be considered as lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 44. MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND SPREAD ON JOURNAL. (a) A member voting on the prevailing side may make a motion to reconsider and spread on the journal, which does not require a vote, and on the motion being made, it shall be entered on the journal. Any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, who desires immediate action on a motion to reconsider which has been spread on the journal, can call it up as soon as it is made, and demand a vote on it, or can call it up and move to table it.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If the motion to table the motion to reconsider is defeated, the motion to reconsider remains spread on the journal for future action; however, any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, can call the motion from the journal for action by the house, and, once disposed of, no other motion to reconsider can be made.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 45. MOTION TO REQUIRE COMMITTEE TO REPORT. (a) During the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 6 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, it shall be in order for a member to move that the committee be required to report the same within 7 calendar days. This motion shall require a two-thirds vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 6 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, it shall be in order for a member to move that the committee be required to report the same within 7 calendar days. This motion shall require a majority vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A motion to instruct a committee to report is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The house shall have no authority to instruct a subcommittee directly; however, instructions recognized under the rules may be given to a committee and shall be binding on all subcommittees.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 46. MOTION TO REREFER TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE. (a) During the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 7 calendar days after the committee was instructed by the house to report that measure by a motion made under Section 45 of this rule, it shall be in order for a member to move to rerefer the bill, resolution, or other paper to a different committee. This motion shall require a two-thirds vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 7 calendar days after the committee has been instructed to report that measure by a motion made under Section 45 of this rule, it shall be in order for a member to move to rerefer the bill, resolution, or other paper to a different committee. This motion shall require a majority vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A motion to rerefer a bill, resolution, or other paper from one committee to another committee is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 8. BILLS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. CONTENTS OF BILLS.

PUBLISHING ACTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. No law shall be revived or amended by reference to its title. The act revived, or the section or sections amended, shall be reenacted and published at length. This rule does not apply to revisions adopted under Article III, Section 43, of the Texas Constitution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. LIMITING A BILL TO A SINGLE SUBJECT.

The signatures of all coauthors or joint authors shall appear on the appropriate forms in the chief clerk&#39;s office.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Any member may become the coauthor of a bill or resolution by securing permission from the author. If permission is secured from the author prior to the time the measure is filed with the chief clerk, the primary author and the coauthor shall sign the appropriate form, which shall be included with the measure when it is filed with the chief clerk. If a member wishes to become the coauthor of a measure after it has been filed, no action shall be required by the house, but it shall be the duty of the member seeking to be a coauthor to obtain written authorization on the appropriate form from the author. This authorization shall be filed with the chief clerk before the coauthor signs the form for the bill or resolution. The chief clerk shall report daily to the journal clerk the names of members filed as coauthors of bills or resolutions. If a coauthor of a bill or resolution desires to withdraw from such status, the member shall notify the chief clerk, who in turn shall notify the journal clerk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The primary author of a measure may designate up to four joint authors by providing written authorization on the appropriate form to the chief clerk.

The chair of the committee must designate a primary sponsor and may designate up to four joint sponsors or an unlimited number of cosponsors. The names of all joint sponsors shall be shown immediately following the primary sponsor&#39;s name on all official printings of the measure, on all house calendars, in the house journal, and in the electronic legislative information system.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. FILING, FIRST READING, AND REFERRAL TO COMMITTEE. Each bill shall be filed with the chief clerk when introduced and shall be numbered in its regular order.

On receipt of the bills or resolutions, the chief clerk shall number them and make them a matter of public record, available for distribution. Once a bill or resolution has been so filed, it may not be recalled. This shall apply only to members-elect of the succeeding legislative session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. DEADLINE FOR INTRODUCTION. (a) Bills and joint resolutions introduced during the first 60 calendar days of the regular session may be considered by the committees and in the house and disposed of at any time during the session, in accordance with the rules of the house.

FILING. (a) A bill must be filed with the chief clerk in the manner and in an electronic or other format specified by the chief clerk at the time that the bill is introduced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A bill relating to conservation and reclamation districts and governed by the provisions of Article XVI, Section 59, of the Texas Constitution must be filed with copies of the notice to introduce the bill attached if the bill is intended to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) create a particular conservation and reclamation district; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) amend the act of a particular conservation and reclamation district to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) add additional land to the district;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) alter the taxing authority of the district;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) alter the authority of the district with respect to issuing bonds; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) alter the qualifications or terms of office of the members of the governing body of the district.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10.

However, this subsection does not prevent consideration of a bill that classifies political subdivisions according to a minimum or maximum population or other criterion that bears a reasonable relation to the purpose of the proposed legislation or a bill that updates laws based on population classifications to conform to a federal decennial census.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Except as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, &quot;local bill&quot; for purposes of this section means:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a bill for which publication of notice is required under Article XVI, Section 59, of the Texas Constitution (water districts, etc.);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a bill for which publication of notice is required under Article IX, Section 9, of the Texas Constitution (hospital districts);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a bill relating to hunting, fishing, or conservation of wildlife resources of a specified locality;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) a bill creating or affecting a county court or statutory court or courts of one or more specified counties or municipalities;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a bill creating or affecting the juvenile board or boards of a specified county or counties; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) a bill creating or affecting a road utility district under the authority of Article III, Section 52, of the Texas Constitution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) A bill is not considered to be a local bill under Subsection (c)(3), (4), or (5) if it affects a sufficient number of localities, counties, or municipalities so as to be of general application or of statewide importance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11.

However, after each section or department has been considered separately, the entire bill or resolution shall be open for amendment, subject to the provisions of Rule 11, Section 8(b). Once the consideration of a bill section by section or department by department has been ordered, it shall not be in order to move the previous question on the entire bill, to recommit it, to lay it on the table, or to postpone it, until each section or department has been given separate consideration or until the vote by which section by section consideration was ordered is reconsidered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to consider a bill section by section is debatable within narrow limits; that is, the pros and cons of the proposed consideration can be debated but not the merits of the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. PASSAGE TO ENGROSSMENT OR THIRD READING. After a bill or complete committee substitute for a bill has been taken up and read, amendments shall be in order.

The speaker shall note on each bill the date and hour of final legislative action and shall withhold his or her signature and any further action on all such bills until the general appropriations bill has been signed by the presiding officers of both houses and transmitted to the comptroller of public accounts for certification. Immediately thereafter, the speaker shall sign in the presence of the house all bills on which further action was being withheld because the bills were subject to the provisions of this section. After being signed by the speaker, the bills shall then be transmitted to the comptroller of public accounts for certification or to the governor, as the case may be, in the order in which final legislative action was taken. &quot;Final legislative action,&quot; as that term is used in this subsection, shall mean the last act of either house meeting in general session necessary to place the bill in its final form preparatory to enrollment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Subsections (a)-(d) of this section shall not apply to any bills providing for:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the payment of expenses of the legislature;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the payment of judgments against the state;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) any emergency matter when requested by the governor in a formal message to the legislature; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the reduction of taxes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e-1) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a bill that prevents the deposit into the general revenue fund of money received from the federal government or earnings on that money if the bill does not prevent that money from being available for the purpose of funding state government generally to the same extent as under existing law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Unless within the authority of a resolution or resolutions adopted pursuant to Article VIII, Section 22(b), of the Texas Constitution, it is not in order for the house to consider for final passage on third reading, on motion to concur in senate amendments, or on motion to adopt a conference committee report, a bill appropriating funds from the state treasury in an amount that, when added to amounts previously appropriated by bills finally passed and sent or due to be sent to the comptroller, would exceed the limit on appropriations established under Chapter 316, Government Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The general appropriations bill shall be reported to the house by the Committee on Appropriations not later than the 90th calendar day of the regular session. Should the Committee on Appropriations fail to report by the deadline, Subsections (a)-(d) of this section shall be suspended for the balance of that regular session.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 9.

If such a joint resolution receives only a majority vote on second reading, it shall be passed to engrossment, and subsequent proceedings shall be the same as those governing the final passage of bills which have been passed to engrossment. If such a joint resolution does not receive a two-thirds vote of the elected membership of the house on third reading and final passage, it shall fail of adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2.

AMENDMENTS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. ACCEPTABLE MOTIONS TO AMEND. When a bill, resolution, motion, or proposition is under consideration, a motion to amend and a motion to amend that amendment shall be in order.

Except for matter to be printed in the journal, all requirements contained in the rules with respect to the printing of bills, resolutions, reports, and other matters shall be considered complied with if the material is adequately and properly reproduced by any acceptable means of reproduction.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 13. INTERACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER A. MESSAGES</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR.

(a) Senate amendments to house bills and resolutions must be printed and copies provided to the members at least 24 hours before any action can be taken thereon by the house during a regular or special session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When a house bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, with senate amendments is returned to the house, the chief clerk shall request the Legislative Budget Board to prepare a fiscal note outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the measure as impacted by the senate amendments. A copy of the fiscal note shall be distributed with the senate amendments on their printing before any action can be taken on the senate amendments by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) When a house bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, with senate amendments is returned to the house, the chief clerk shall request the Texas Legislative Council to prepare an analysis that describes the substantive changes made to the house version of the bill by the senate amendments. A copy of the council&#39;s analysis of senate amendments shall be provided to the members electronically or as a printed copy at least 12 hours before action is taken on the senate amendments by the house. The Texas Legislative Council shall make all reasonable efforts to timely provide the analysis in as accurate a form as time allows. However, an unavoidable inability to provide the analysis or an inadvertent error in the analysis is not subject to a point of order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) When a house bill or joint resolution for which a tax equity note was required under Rule 4, Section 34(b)(5), is returned to the house with senate amendments, the chief clerk shall request the Legislative Budget Board to prepare a tax equity note estimating the general effects of the senate amendments on the distribution of tax and fee burdens among individuals and businesses. A copy of the updated tax equity note shall be made available to each member, in some format, before any vote on the floor can be taken on the senate amendments by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER C.

Failure to comply with this subsection is not subject to a point of order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. MEETINGS. (a) House conferees when meeting with senate conferees to adjust differences shall meet in public and shall give a reasonable amount of notice of the meeting in the place designated for giving notice of meetings of house standing committees. Any such meeting shall be open to the news media. Any conference committee report adopted in private shall not be considered by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) At a meeting of the conferees to adjust differences on the general appropriations bill, the chair of the house conferees may request the assistance of any house member who serves on the appropriations committee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. INSTRUCTIONS. Instructions to a conference committee shall be made after the conference is ordered and before the conferees are appointed by the speaker, and not thereafter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. LIMITATIONS ON JURISDICTION. (a) Conference committees shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. A conference committee shall have no authority with respect to any bill or resolution:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) to change, alter, or amend text which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) to omit text which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) to add text on any matter which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) to add text on any matter which is not included in either the house or senate version of the bill or resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Conference committees on appropriations bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on appropriations bills shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and in identical amounts, no change can be made in the item or the amount.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but in different amounts, no change can be made in the item, but the amount shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that the amount shall not exceed the larger version and shall not be less than the smaller version.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) If an item of appropriation appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee. If the item is included, the amount shall not exceed the sum specified in the version containing the item.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If an item of appropriation appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report. However, the conference committee report may include appropriations for purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed and sent to the governor and may include contingent appropriations for purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed by at least one house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Conference committees on tax bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on a tax bill shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and in identical form and with identical rates, no change can be made in the item or the rate provided.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but at differing rates, no change can be made in the item, but the rate shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that the rate shall not exceed the higher version and shall not be less than the lower version.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) If a tax item appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee. If the item is included, the rate shall not exceed the rate specified in the version containing the item.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If a tax item appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Conference committees on reapportionment bills, to the extent possible, shall limit their discussions and their actions to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. Since the adjustment of one district in a reapportionment bill will inevitably affect other districts, the strict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees must be relaxed somewhat when reapportionment bills are involved. Accordingly, the following authority and limitations shall apply only to conference committees on reapportionment bills:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the matters in disagreement affect only certain districts, and other districts are identical in both house and senate versions of the bill, the conference committee shall make adjustments only in those districts whose rearrangement is essential to the effective resolving of the matters in disagreement. All other districts shall remain unchanged.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If the matters in disagreement permeate the entire bill and affect most, if not all, of the districts, the conference committee shall have wide discretion in rearranging the districts to the extent necessary to resolve all differences between the two houses.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Insofar as the actual structure of the districts is concerned, and only to that extent, the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to conference committees on reapportionment bills.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Conference committees on recodification bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. The comprehensive and complicated nature of recodification bills makes necessary the relaxing of the strict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees only to the following extent:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If it develops in conference committee that material has been inadvertently included in both house and senate versions which properly has no place in the recodification, that material may be omitted from the conference committee report, if by that omission the existing statute is not repealed, altered, or amended.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If it develops in conference committee that material has been inadvertently omitted from both the house and senate versions which properly should be included if the recodification is to achieve its purpose of being all-inclusive of the statutes being recodified, that material may be added to the conference committee report, if by the addition the existing statute is merely restated without substantive change in existing law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Limitations imposed on certain conference committees by the provisions of this section may be suspended in part by permission of the house to allow consideration of and action on a specific matter or matters which otherwise would be prohibited. Permission shall be granted only by resolution passed by majority vote of the house. All such resolutions shall be privileged in nature and need not be referred to a committee. The introduction of such a resolution shall be announced from the house floor and the resolution shall be eligible for consideration by the house:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) three hours after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each member; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) for a resolution suspending limitations on a conference committee considering the general appropriations bill, 48 hours in a regular session and 24 hours in a special session after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The time at which the copies of such a resolution are distributed to the members shall be time-stamped on the originals of the resolution. The resolution shall specify in detail:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the exact language of the matter or matters proposed to be considered;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the specific limitation or limitations to be suspended;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the specific action contemplated by the conference committee;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) except for a resolution suspending the limitations on the conferees for the general appropriations bill, the reasons that suspension of the limitations is being requested; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a fiscal note distributed with the resolution outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the items to be included in the conference committee report that would otherwise be prohibited but for the passage of the resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) In the application of Subsection (g) of this section to appropriations bills, the resolution:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) need not include changes in amounts resulting from a proposed salary plan or changes in format that do not affect the amount of an appropriation or the method of finance of an appropriation, but shall include a general statement describing the salary plan or format change;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) need not include differences in language which do not affect the substance of the bill;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) if suspending a limitation imposed by Subsection (b)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section, must specify the amount by which the appropriation in the conference committee report is less than or greater than the amount permitted for that item of appropriation under Subsection (b) of this section; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) shall be available in its entirety on the electronic legislative information system that is accessible by the general public.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Permission granted by a resolution under Subsection (f) of this section shall suspend the limitations only for the matter or matters clearly specified in the resolution, and the action of the conference committee shall be in conformity with the resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10. PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS. (a) A conference committee report on the general appropriations bill must be printed and a copy furnished to each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 48 hours before action can be taken on the report by the house during a regular session or at least 24 hours before action can be taken by the house during a special session. All other conference committee reports must be printed and a copy furnished to each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 24 hours before action can be taken on the report by the house during a regular or special session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Three original copies of a conference committee report shall be submitted to the chief clerk for printing. Each original conference committee report shall contain the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the signatures of the house conferees and senate conferees who voted to adopt the conference committee report;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the text of the bill or resolution as adopted by the conference committee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) an analysis of the conference committee report as required by Section 11 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Before action can be taken by the house on a conference committee report on a bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, a fiscal note outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the conference committee report shall be submitted to the chief clerk, and a copy of the fiscal note shall be distributed with the conference committee report on its printing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Before a vote on the floor can be taken by the house on a conference committee report on a bill or joint resolution for which a tax equity note was required under Rule 4, Section 34(b)(5), a tax equity note estimating the general effects of the conference committee report on the distribution of tax and fee burdens among individuals and businesses shall be submitted to the chief clerk, and a copy of the tax equity note shall be made available to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11. ANALYSIS OF REPORTS. (a) All reports of conference committees shall include an analysis showing wherein the report differs from the house and senate versions of the bill, resolution, or other matter in disagreement. The analysis of appropriations bills shall show in dollar amounts the differences between the conference committee report and the house and senate versions. No conference committee report shall be considered by the house unless such an analysis has been prepared and distributed to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The analysis shall to the extent practical indicate any instance wherein the conference committee in its report appears to have exceeded the limitations imposed on its jurisdiction by Section 9 of this rule. An analysis and the conference committee report in which the analysis is included are not subject to a point of order due to a failure to comply with this subsection or due to a mistake made in complying with this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS. A conference committee report is not subject to amendment, but must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. While a conference committee report is pending, a motion to deal with individual amendments in disagreement is not in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. WHEN REPORTS NOT ACCEPTABLE. When a conference committee report is not acceptable to the house for any reason, it may be recommitted to the same committee with the request for further consideration, and the house may or may not give any specific instructions on the report to the conference committee; or the house may request the appointment by the senate of a new conference committee and then proceed to empower the speaker to name new conferees for the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 14. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. WHEN RULES ARE SILENT. If the rules are silent or inexplicit on any question of order or parliamentary practice, the Rules of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and its practice as reflected in published precedents, and Mason&#39;s Manual of Legislative Procedure shall be considered as authority.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES. (a) Amendments to the rules of the house shall be proposed by house resolutions which shall be referred at once, without debate, to the Committee on House Administration for study and recommendation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A resolution proposing an amendment to the rules shall not be considered by the house until a printed copy of the resolution has been provided to each member of the house at least 48 hours before consideration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Amendments to the rules shall require a majority vote of the house for adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES. A motion to suspend the rules shall be in order at any time, except when motions to adjourn or recess are pending, even when the house is operating under the previous question. A motion to &quot;suspend all rules&quot; shall be sufficient to suspend every rule under which the house is operating for a particular purpose except the provisions of the constitution and the joint rules of the two houses. If the rules have been suspended on a main motion for a given purpose, no other motion to suspend the rules on a main motion shall be in order until the original purpose has been accomplished.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. NOTICE OF PENDING MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES. It shall not be in order to move to suspend the rules or the regular order of business to take up a measure out of its regular order, and the speaker shall not recognize anyone for either purpose, unless the speaker has announced to the house in session that the speaker would recognize a member for that purpose at least one hour before the member is so recognized to make the motion. In making the announcement to the house, the speaker shall advise the house of the member&#39;s name and the bill number, and this information, together with the time that the announcement was made, shall be entered in the journal. This rule may be suspended only by unanimous consent.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. VOTE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSPENSION. A standing rule of the house may be suspended by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present. However, if a rule contains a specific provision showing the vote by which that rule may be suspended, that vote shall be required for the suspension of the rule. The specific provision may not be suspended under the provisions of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. DISPOSAL OF MEASURES TAKEN UP UNDER SUSPENSION. Any measure taken up under suspension and not disposed of on the same day shall go over as pending or unfinished business to the next day that the house is in session, and shall be considered thereafter from day to day (except the days used for the consideration of senate bills) until disposed of.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 15. APPROPRIATE WORKPLACE CONDUCT</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. STATEMENT OF POLICY. (a) The house finds that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a safe and professional environment in which each individual is treated with respect is essential for conducting the legislative business of Texas;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) harassment based on an individual&#39;s characteristics and activity protected by law is inconsistent with the necessary safe and professional environment; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) there is a need for policies designed to prevent harassment and to appropriately address it if it occurs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The house declares that all forms of harassment prohibited by law (including harassment by the making of a complaint of harassment or discrimination or by participating in the investigation of a complaint) are against the policy of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Members, officers, and employees of the house are expected to promote public confidence in the integrity of the house by:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) conducting themselves in a manner that is free of harassment in each setting related to the service of the member, officer, or employee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) reporting any harassment in the workplace of which they have direct, personal knowledge.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) This rule is the policy on which the house relies for guidance in promoting appropriate workplace conduct. This rule is not intended to, and does not, create an independent cause of action, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the house or its officers, employees, or agents;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the State of Texas or its departments, agencies, entities, officers, employees, or agents; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) any other person.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 16. SPECIAL RULE</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. PURPOSE; SCOPE; APPLICATION. (a) This rule is adopted to ensure that the house is able to carry out its legislative responsibilities under the Texas Constitution in the event of disruptions caused by actual or imminent threat of an emergency, including an epidemic or a pandemic.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A section of this rule governs the procedure of the house and its committees only when the section is activated as provided by this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) During the time a section of this rule is activated, the provisions of that section prevail over a provision of Rules 1 through 15 to the extent of any conflict between the provisions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) This chapter is not subject to deactivation under Section 4 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. ACTIVATION AND REACTIVATION. (a) A section of this rule may be activated only as provided by this section. A section of this rule that has been deactivated under this chapter may be reactivated only as provided by this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Activation or reactivation of a section of this rule may occur only if:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a disaster has been declared and is currently in effect in this state as the result of a declaration by:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) the president of the United States under the Robert T.

LIMITATIONS ON JURISDICTION. (a) Conference committees shall limit\ntheir discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement\nbetween the two houses. A conference committee shall have no authority with\nrespect to any bill or resolution:\n\n(1) to change, alter, or amend text which is not in disagreement;\n\n(2) to omit text which is not in disagreement;\n\n(3) to add text on any matter which is not in disagreement;\n\n(4) to add text on any matter which is not included in either the house or\nsenate version of the bill or resolution.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(b) Conference committees on appropriations bills, like other conference\ncommittees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the\nmatters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations\ncontained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on appropriations\nbills shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:\n\n(1) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.\n\n(2) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill, and in identical amounts, no change can be made in the item or the\namount.\n\n(3) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill but in different amounts, no change can be made in the item, but the\namount shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that\nthe amount shall not exceed the larger version and shall not be less than the\nsmaller version.\n\n(4) If an item of appropriation appears in one version of the bill and not in\nthe other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the\nconference committee. If the item is included, the amount shall not exceed the\nsum specified in the version containing the item.\n\n(5) If an item of appropriation appears in neither the house nor the senate\nversion of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee\nreport. However, the conference committee report may include appropriations\nfor purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed and sent to\nthe governor and may include contingent appropriations for purposes or\nprograms authorized by bills that have been passed by at least one house.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(c) Conference committees on tax bills, like other conference committees,\nshall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in\ndisagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained\nelsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on a tax bill shall be strictly\nlimited in its authority as follows:\n\n(1) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the\nitem must be included in the conference committee report.\n\n(2) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and\nin identical form and with identical rates, no change can be made in the item\nor the rate provided.\n\n(3) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but at\ndiffering rates, no change can be made in the item, but the rate shall be at\nthe discretion of the conference committee, provided that the rate shall not\nexceed the higher version and shall not be less than the lower version.\n\n(4) If a tax item appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the\nitem can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee.\nIf the item is included, the rate shall not exceed the rate specified in the\nversion containing the item.\n\n(5) If a tax item appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the\nbill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(d) Conference committees on reapportionment bills, to the extent possible,\nshall limit their discussions and their actions to the matters in disagreement\nbetween the two houses. Since the adjustment of one district in a\nreapportionment bill will inevitably affect other districts, the strict rule\nof construction imposed on other conference committees must be relaxed\nsomewhat when reapportionment bills are involved. Accordingly, the following\nauthority and limitations shall apply only to conference committees on\nreapportionment bills:\n\n(1) If the matters in disagreement affect only certain districts, and other\ndistricts are identical in both house and senate versions of the bill, the\nconference committee shall make adjustments only in those districts whose\nrearrangement is essential to the effective resolving of the matters in\ndisagreement. All other districts shall remain unchanged.\n\n(2) If the matters in disagreement permeate the entire bill and affect most,\nif not all, of the districts, the conference committee shall have wide\ndiscretion in rearranging the districts to the extent necessary to resolve all\ndifferences between the two houses.\n\n(3) Insofar as the actual structure of the districts is concerned, and only to\nthat extent, the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply\nto conference committees on reapportionment bills.\n\n(e) Conference committees on recodification bills, like other conference\ncommittees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the\nmatters in disagreement between the two houses. The comprehensive and\ncomplicated nature of recodification bills makes necessary the relaxing of the\nstrict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees only to the\nfollowing extent:\n\n(1) If it develops in conference committee that material has been\ninadvertently included in both house and senate versions which properly has no\nplace in the recodification, that material may be omitted from the conference\ncommittee report, if by that omission the existing statute is not repealed,\naltered, or amended.\n\n(2) If it develops in conference committee that material has been\ninadvertently omitted from both the house and senate versions which properly\nshould be included if the recodification is to achieve its purpose of being\nall-inclusive of the statutes being recodified, that material may be added to\nthe conference committee report, if by the addition the existing statute is\nmerely restated without substantive change in existing law.\n\n(f) Limitations imposed on certain conference committees by the provisions of\nthis section may be suspended in part by permission of the house to allow\nconsideration of and action on a specific matter or matters which otherwise\nwould be prohibited. Permission shall be granted only by resolution passed by\nmajority vote of the house. All such resolutions shall be privileged in nature\nand need not be referred to a committee. The introduction of such a resolution\nshall be announced from the house floor and the resolution shall be eligible\nfor consideration by the house:\n\n(1) three hours after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each\nmember; or\n\n(2) for a resolution suspending limitations on a conference committee\nconsidering the general appropriations bill, 48 hours in a regular session and\n24 hours in a special session after a copy of the resolution has been\ndistributed to each member.\n\n(g) The time at which the copies of such a resolution are distributed to the\nmembers shall be time-stamped on the originals of the resolution. The\nresolution shall specify in detail:\n\n(1) the exact language of the matter or matters proposed to be considered;\n\n(2) the specific limitation or limitations to be suspended;\n\n(3) the specific action contemplated by the conference committee;\n\n(4) except for a resolution suspending the limitations on the conferees for\nthe general appropriations bill, the reasons that suspension of the\nlimitations is being requested; and\n\n(5) a fiscal note distributed with the resolution outlining the fiscal\nimplications and probable cost of the items to be included in the conference\ncommittee report that would otherwise be prohibited but for the passage of the\nresolution.\n\n(h) In the application of Subsection (g) of this section to appropriations\nbills, the resolution:\n\n(1) need not include changes in amounts resulting from a proposed salary plan\nor changes in format that do not affect the amount of an appropriation or the\nmethod of finance of an appropriation, but shall include a general statement\ndescribing the salary plan or format change;\n\n(2) need not include differences in language which do not affect the substance\nof the bill;\n\n(3) if suspending a limitation imposed by Subsection (b)(2), (3), (4), or (5)\nof this section, must specify the amount by which the appropriation in the\nconference committee report is less than or greater than the amount permitted\nfor that item of appropriation under Subsection (b) of this section; and\n\n(4) shall be available in its entirety on the electronic legislative\ninformation system that is accessible by the general public.\n\n(i) Permission granted by a resolution under Subsection (f) of this section\nshall suspend the limitations only for the matter or matters clearly specified\nin the resolution, and the action of the conference committee shall be in\nconformity with the resolution.\n\nSec. 10. PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS. (a) A conference committee\nreport on the general appropriations bill must be printed and a copy furnished\nto each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 48 hours before\naction can be taken on the report by the house during a regular session or at\nleast 24 hours before action can be taken by the house during a special\nsession.

The\nanalysis of appropriations bills shall show in dollar amounts the differences\nbetween the conference committee report and the house and senate versions. No\nconference committee report shall be considered by the house unless such an\nanalysis has been prepared and distributed to each member.\n\n(b) The analysis shall to the extent practical indicate any instance wherein\nthe conference committee in its report appears to have exceeded the\nlimitations imposed on its jurisdiction by Section 9 of this rule. An analysis\nand the conference committee report in which the analysis is included are not\nsubject to a point of order due to a failure to comply with this subsection or\ndue to a mistake made in complying with this subsection.\n\nSec. 12. CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS. A conference committee report is not\nsubject to amendment, but must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. While\na conference committee report is pending, a motion to deal with individual\namendments in disagreement is not in order.\n\nSec. 13. WHEN REPORTS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 1.

CALL TO ORDER. The speaker shall take the chair on each calendar day precisely at the hour to which the house adjourned or recessed at its last sitting and shall immediately call the members to order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. LAYING BUSINESS BEFORE THE HOUSE. The speaker shall lay before the house its business in the order indicated by the rules and shall receive propositions made by members and put them to the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. REFERRAL OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO COMMITTEE. All proposed legislation shall be referred by the speaker to an appropriate standing <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">committee, permanent standing subcommittee,</u> or select committee with jurisdiction, subject to correction by a majority vote of the house. A bill or resolution may not be referred simultaneously to more than one committee <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or subcommittee</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. PRESERVATION OF ORDER AND DECORUM. The speaker shall preserve order and decorum. In case of disturbance or disorderly conduct in the galleries or in the lobby, the speaker may order that these areas be cleared. No signs, placards, or other objects of similar nature shall be permitted in the rooms, lobby, gallery, and hall of the house. The speaker shall see that the members of the house conduct themselves in a civil manner in accordance with accepted standards of parliamentary conduct and may, when necessary, order the sergeant-at-arms to clear the aisles and seat the members of the house so that business may be conducted in an orderly manner.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. RECOGNITION OF GALLERY VISITORS. On written request of a member, the speaker may recognize persons in the gallery. The speaker shall afford that recognition at a convenient place in the order of business, considering the need for order and decorum and the need for continuity of debate. The request must be made on a form prescribed by the Committee on House Administration. The speaker may recognize, at a time he or she considers appropriate during floor proceedings, the person serving as physician of the day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. STATING AND VOTING ON QUESTIONS. The speaker shall rise to put a question but may state it sitting. The question shall be put substantially in this form: &quot;The question occurs on</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">______&quot; (here state the question or proposition under consideration). &quot;All in favor say &#39;Aye,&#39;&quot; and after the affirmative vote is expressed, &quot;All opposed say &#39;No.&#39;&quot; If the speaker is in doubt as to the result, or if a division is called for, the house shall divide: those voting in the affirmative on the question shall register &quot;Aye&quot; on the voting machine, and those voting in the negative on the question shall register &quot;No.&quot; The decision of the house on the question shall be printed in the journal and shall include the yeas and nays if a record of the yeas and nays is ordered in accordance with the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. VOTING RIGHTS OF THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The speaker shall have the same right as other members to vote. If the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, has not voted, he or she may cast the deciding vote at the time such opportunity becomes official, whether to make or break a tie. If a verification of the vote is called for and granted, the decision of the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, to cast the deciding vote need not be made until the verification has been completed. In case of error in a vote, if the correction leaves decisive effect to the vote of the speaker, or a member temporarily presiding, the deciding vote may be cast even though the result has been announced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. QUESTIONS OF ORDER. (a) The speaker shall decide on all questions of order; however, such decisions are subject to an appeal to the house made by any 10 members. Pending an appeal, the speaker shall call a member to the chair, who shall not have the authority to entertain or decide any other matter or proposition until the appeal has first been determined by the house. The question on appeal is, &quot;Shall the chair be sustained?&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No member shall speak more than once on an appeal unless given leave by a majority of the house. No motion shall be in order, pending an appeal, except a motion to adjourn, a motion to lay on the table, a motion for the previous question, or a motion for a call of the house. Responses to parliamentary inquiries and decisions of recognition made by the chair may not be appealed, except as provided by Rule 5, Section 24.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Further consideration of the matter or proposition that is the subject of a question of order is prohibited until the speaker decides the question of order and any appeal of that decision has been determined by the house. Consideration of any other matter or proposition is also prohibited while a question of order is pending, unless the question of order is temporarily withdrawn and the matter or proposition that is the subject of the question of order is postponed. Withdrawal of the question of order does not prevent any member from raising that question of order when the matter or proposition is again before the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) A point of order raised as to a violation of a section of the rules governing committee reports, committee minutes, or accompanying documentation may be overruled if the purpose of that section of the rules has been substantially fulfilled and the violation does not deceive or mislead.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) When a question of order is pending before the house, only the member who raised the question of order, and one other member designated by that member, and the primary proponent of the matter or proposition to which the question of order applies, and one other member designated by the proponent, may present arguments to the speaker or parliamentarian regarding the question of order.

In the event of an emergency of such compelling nature that the speaker must adjourn the house without fixing a date and hour of reconvening, the speaker shall have authority to determine the date and hour of reconvening and to notify the members of the house by any means the speaker considers adequate. Should the speaker be disabled or otherwise unable to exercise these emergency powers, the permanent speaker pro tempore, if one has been named, shall have authority to act. If there is no permanent speaker pro tempore, or if that officer is unable to act, authority shall be exercised by the chair of the Committee on State Affairs, who shall preside until the house can proceed to the selection of a temporary presiding officer to function until the speaker or the speaker pro tempore is again able to exercise the duties and responsibilities of the office.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. POSTPONEMENT OF RECONVENING. When the house is not in session, if the speaker determines that it would be a hazard to the safety of the members, officers, employees, and others attending the legislature to reconvene at the time determined by the house at its last sitting, the speaker may clear the area of the capitol under the control of the house and postpone the reconvening of the house for a period of not more than 12 hours. On making that determination, the speaker shall order the sergeant-at-arms to post an assistant at each first floor entrance to the capitol and other places and advise all persons entering of the determination and the time set for the house to reconvene.

This provision shall have precedence over Rule 7, Section 20.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. ADVERSE REPORTS ON LOCAL BILLS.

The committee may impose a fee to cover the costs of issuing a pass card. This pass card must be presented to the doorkeeper each time the person seeks admission to the floor of the house while the house is in session. Pass cards issued under this section shall not be transferable. The failure of a media representative to maintain the requirements of this section may result in the revocation of the pass card. Persons admitted to the floor of the house pursuant to the provisions of this section shall work in appropriate convenient seats or work stations in the house, which shall be designated for that purpose by the Committee on House Administration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Members of the house shall not engage in interviews and press conferences on the house floor while the house is in session. The Committee on House Administration is authorized to enforce this provision and to prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary and desirable to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Permission to make recordings in or from the house chamber while the house is in session may be granted only by the Committee on House Administration.

Passes granted under this authority shall be subject to revocation by the Committee on House Administration. As used in this subsection, &quot;recording&quot; means an audio, video, or photographic recording for immediate or delayed transmission by television or radio or through the Internet.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The following individuals may submit a written complaint regarding a decision by the Committee on House Administration under this section:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) an individual who is aggrieved by the committee&#39;s failure or refusal to grant privileges under this section; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a member of the house who believes a media representative granted privileges under this section either does not meet the requirements of this section or has abused the privileges granted under this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) The Committee on House Administration shall investigate the complaint and may, if necessary, temporarily suspend the media representative&#39;s privileges pending the investigation. The committee shall notify the aggrieved individual or subject of the complaint of the time and place of a hearing on the complaint.

SPEAKING AND DEBATE</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. ADDRESSING THE HOUSE. When a member desires to speak or deliver any matter to the house, the member shall rise and respectfully address the speaker as &quot;Mr. (or Madam) Speaker&quot; and, on being recognized, may address the house from the microphone at the reading clerk&#39;s desk, and shall confine all remarks to the question under debate, avoiding personalities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. WHEN TWO MEMBERS RISE AT ONCE. When two or more members rise at once, the speaker shall name the one who is to speak first. This decision shall be final and not open to debate or appeal.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. RECOGNITION. (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, there shall be no appeal from the speaker&#39;s recognition, but the speaker shall be governed by rules and usage in priority of entertaining motions from the floor. When a member seeks recognition, the speaker may ask, &quot;For what purpose does the member rise?&quot; or &quot;For what purpose does the member seek recognition?&quot; and may then decide if recognition is to be granted, except that the speaker shall recognize a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If the speaker denies recognition of a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege, other than a question of privilege relating to the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker, the decision of recognition may be appealed using the procedures provided in Rule 1, Section 9.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) If the speaker denies recognition of a member who seeks recognition on a question of privilege relating to the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker, the member may appeal the speaker&#39;s denial of recognition if the member submits to the speaker a written request, signed by at least 76 members of the house, to appeal the decision of recognition. Upon receiving a request for appeal in accordance with this subsection, the speaker shall announce the request to the house. The names of the members who signed the request and the time that the announcement was made shall be entered in the journal. The appeal of a decision of recognition under this subsection is eligible for consideration 24 hours after the request for appeal has been announced in accordance with this subsection. The appeal and consideration of the question of privilege, if the appeal is successful, takes precedence over all other questions except motions to adjourn.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. INTERRUPTION OF A MEMBER WHO HAS THE FLOOR. A member who has the floor shall not be interrupted by another member for any purpose, unless he or she consents to yield to the other member. A member desiring to interrupt another in debate should first address the speaker for the permission of the member speaking. The speaker shall then ask the member who has the floor if he or she wishes to yield, and then announce the decision of that member. The member who has the floor may exercise personal discretion as to whether or not to yield, and it is entirely within the member&#39;s discretion to determine who shall interrupt and when.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 26. YIELDING THE FLOOR. A member who obtains the floor on recognition of the speaker may not be taken off the floor by a motion, even the highly privileged motion to adjourn, but if the member yields to another to make a motion or to offer an amendment, he or she thereby loses the floor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 27. RIGHT TO OPEN AND CLOSE DEBATE. The mover of any proposition, or the member reporting any measure from a committee, or, in the absence of either of them, any other member designated by such absentee, shall have the right to open and close the debate, and for this purpose may speak each time not more than 20 minutes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 28. TIME LIMITS ON SPEECHES. All speeches shall be limited to 10 minutes in duration, except as provided in Section 27 of this rule, and the speaker shall call the members to order at the expiration of their time. If the house by a majority vote extends the time of any member, the extension shall be for 10 minutes only. A second extension of time shall be granted only by unanimous consent. During the last 10 calendar days of the regular session, and the last 5 calendar days of a special session, Sundays excepted, all speeches shall be limited to 10 minutes and shall not be extended. The time limits established by this rule shall include time consumed in yielding to questions from the floor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 29. LIMIT ON NUMBER OF TIMES TO SPEAK. No member shall speak more than twice on the same question without leave of the house, nor more than once until every member choosing to speak has spoken, nor shall any member be permitted to consume the time of another member without leave of the house being given by a majority vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 30. EFFECT OF ADJOURNMENT ON SPEAKING LIMIT. If a pending question is not disposed of because of an adjournment of the house, a member who has spoken twice on the subject shall not be allowed to speak again without leave of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. OBJECTION TO READING A PAPER. When the reading of a paper is called for, and objection is made, the matter shall be determined by a majority vote of the house, without debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 32. PASSING BETWEEN MICROPHONES DURING DEBATE. No person shall pass between the front and back microphones during debate or when a member has the floor and is addressing the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 33. TRANSGRESSION OF RULES WHILE SPEAKING. If any member, in speaking or otherwise, transgresses the rules of the house, the speaker shall, or any member may, call the member to order, in which case the member so called to order shall immediately be seated; however, that member may move for an appeal to the house, and if appeal is duly seconded by 10 members, the matter shall be submitted to the house for decision by majority vote. In such cases, the speaker shall not be required to relinquish the chair, as is required in cases of appeals from the speaker&#39;s decisions. The house shall, if appealed to, decide the matter without debate. If the decision is in favor of the member called to order, the member shall be at liberty to proceed; but if the decision is against the member, he or she shall not be allowed to proceed, and, if the case requires it, shall be liable to the censure of the house, or such other punishment as the house may consider proper.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 34. ELECTRONIC RECORDING OF ALL HOUSE PROCEEDINGS. (a) All proceedings of the house of representatives shall be electronically recorded under the direction of the Committee on House Administration. Copies of the proceedings may be released under guidelines promulgated by the Committee on House Administration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Archived video broadcasts of proceedings in the house chamber that are available through the house&#39;s Internet or intranet website may, under the direction of the Committee on House Administration, include a link to the point in time in the video where each measure under consideration by the house is laid out. Such a link shall be provided as soon as the committee determines is practical.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER D. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 35. QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE DEFINED. Questions of privilege shall be:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) those affecting the rights of the house collectively, its safety and dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings, including the right of the house to remove the speaker and elect a new speaker; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) those affecting the rights, reputation, and conduct of members individually in their representative capacity only.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 36. PRECEDENCE OF QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE. Questions of privilege shall have precedence over all other questions except motions to adjourn. When in order, a member may address the house on a question of privilege, or may at any time print it in the journal, provided it contains no reflection on any member of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 37. WHEN QUESTIONS OF PRIVILEGE NOT IN ORDER. (a) It shall not be in order for a member to address the house on a question of privilege:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) between the time an undebatable motion is offered and the vote is taken on the motion;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) between the time the previous question is ordered and the vote is taken on the last proposition included under the previous question; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) between the time a motion to table is offered and the vote is taken on the motion.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If a question of privilege relating to removal of the speaker and election of a new speaker fails, a subsequent attempt to remove the same speaker can be made only by reconsidering the vote by which the original question of privilege failed. Such reconsideration shall be subject to the rules of the house governing reconsideration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 38. CONFINING REMARKS TO QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE; INTERRUPTIONS PROHIBITED. (a) When speaking on privilege, members must confine their remarks within the limits of Section 35 of this rule, which will be strictly construed to achieve the purposes hereof.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When a member is speaking on privilege, the member shall not be interrupted by another member for any purpose. While the member is speaking, another member may submit a question of order to the speaker in writing or by approaching the podium in person. The member submitting the question of order shall not interrupt the member who is speaking. The speaker may interrupt the member who is speaking if the speaker determines it is appropriate to address the question of order at that time.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 39. DISCUSSION OF MERITS OF MOTION FORBIDDEN. Merits of a main or subsidiary motion shall not be discussed or debated under the guise of speaking to a question of privilege.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER E. VOTING</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 40. RECORDING ALL VOTES ON VOTING MACHINE. On all votes, except viva voce votes, members shall record their votes on the voting machine and shall not be recognized by the chair to cast their votes from the floor. If a member attempts to vote from the floor, the speaker shall sustain a point of order directed against the member&#39;s so doing. This rule shall not be applicable to the mover or the principal opponent of the proposition being voted on nor to a member whose voting machine is out of order. If a member demands strict enforcement of this section, Section 47 shall not apply to the taking of a vote, and the house may discipline a member in violation of this rule pursuant to its inherent authority.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 41. REGISTRATION EQUIVALENT TO ROLL CALL VOTE. A registration or vote taken on the voting machine of the house shall in all instances be considered the equivalent of a roll call or yea and nay vote, which might be had for the same purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 42. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL OR PRIVATE INTEREST. Any member who has a personal or private interest in any measure or bill proposed or pending before the house shall disclose the fact and not vote thereon.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 43. DIVIDING THE QUESTION. By a majority vote of the house, a quorum being present, the question shall be divided, if it includes propositions so distinct in substance that, one being taken away, a substantive proposition remains. A motion for a division vote cannot be made after the previous question has been ordered, after a motion to table has been offered, after the question has been put, nor after the yeas and nays have been ordered. Under this subsection, the speaker may divide the question into groups of propositions that are closely related.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 44. FAILURE OR REFUSAL TO VOTE. Any member who is present and fails or refuses to vote after being requested to do so by the speaker shall be recorded as present but not voting, and shall be counted for the purpose of making a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 45. PRESENCE IN HOUSE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO VOTE. A member must be on the floor of the house or in an adjacent room or hallway on the same level as the house floor, in order to vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 46. LOCKING VOTING MACHINES OF ABSENT MEMBERS. During each calendar day in which the house is in session, it shall be the duty of the journal clerk to lock the voting machine of each member who is excused or who is otherwise known to be absent. Each such machine shall remain locked until the member in person contacts the journal clerk and personally requests the unlocking of the machine. Unless otherwise directed by the speaker, the journal clerk shall not unlock any machine except at the personal request of the member to whom the machine is assigned. Any violation, or any attempt by a member or employee to circumvent the letter or spirit of this section, shall be reported immediately to the speaker for such disciplinary action by the speaker, or by the house, as may be warranted under the circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 47. VOTING FOR ANOTHER MEMBER. Any member found guilty by the house of knowingly voting for another member on the voting machine without that other member&#39;s permission shall be subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 48. INTERRUPTION OF A ROLL CALL. Once a roll call has begun, it may not be interrupted for any reason. While a yea and nay vote is being taken, or the vote is being counted, no member shall visit the reading clerk&#39;s desk or the voting clerk&#39;s desk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 49. EXPLANATION OF VOTE. (a) No member shall be allowed to interrupt the vote or to make any explanation of a vote that the member is about to give after the voting machine has been opened, but may record in the journal the reasons for giving such a vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; must be in writing and filed with the journal clerk. If timely received, the &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; shall be printed immediately following the results of the vote in the journal. Otherwise, &quot;Reasons for Vote&quot; shall be printed in a separate section at the end of the journal for the day on which the reasons were recorded with the journal clerk. Such &quot;Reason for Vote&quot; shall not deal in personalities or contain any personal reflection on any member of the legislature, the speaker, the lieutenant governor, or the governor, and shall not in any other manner transgress the rules of the house relating to decorum and debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A member absent when a vote was taken may file with the journal clerk while the house is in session a statement of how the member would have voted if present. If timely received, the statement shall be printed immediately following the results of the vote in the journal. Otherwise, statements shall be printed in a separate section at the end of the journal for the day on which the statements were recorded with the journal clerk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 50. PAIRS. (a) All pairs must be announced before the vote is declared by the speaker, and a written statement sent to the journal clerk. The statement must be signed by the absent member to the pair, or the member&#39;s signature must have been authorized in writing or by telephone, and satisfactory evidence presented to the speaker if deemed necessary. If authorized in writing, the writing shall be delivered to the chief clerk by personal delivery or by commercially acceptable means of delivery, including electronic transmission by PDF or similar secure format that is capable of transmitting an accurate image of the member&#39;s signature. If authorized by telephone, the call must be to and confirmed by the chief clerk in advance of the vote to which it applies. Pairs shall be entered in the journal, and the member present shall be counted to make a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The speaker may not refuse to recognize a pair that complies with the requirements of Subsection (a), if both members consent to the pair.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 51. ENTRY OF YEA AND NAY VOTE IN JOURNAL. (a) At the desire of any member present, the yeas and nays of the members of the house on any question shall be taken and entered in the journal. No member or members shall be allowed to call for a yea and nay vote after a vote has been declared by the speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to expunge a yea and nay vote from the journal shall not be in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The yeas and nays of the members of the house on final passage of any bill, any joint resolution proposing or ratifying a constitutional amendment, and any other resolution, other than a resolution of a purely ceremonial or honorary nature, shall be taken and entered in the journal. For purposes of this subsection, a vote on final passage includes a vote on:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) third reading;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) second reading if the house suspends or otherwise dispenses with the requirement for three readings;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) whether to concur in the senate&#39;s amendments; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) whether to adopt a conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 51A. REAL-TIME ACCESS BY PUBLIC TO YEAS AND NAYS. The Committee on House Administration shall ensure that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the recorded yeas and nays are available to the public on the Internet and on any televised broadcast of the house proceedings produced by or under the direction of the house; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) members of the public may view the yeas and nays in real time to the extent possible on the Internet and on any televised broadcast of the house proceedings produced by or under the direction of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 52. JOURNAL RECORDING OF VOTES ON ANY QUESTION. On any question where a record of the yeas and nays has not been ordered, members may have their votes recorded in the journal as &quot;yea&quot; or &quot;nay&quot; by filing such information with the journal clerk before adjournment or recess to another calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 53. CHANGING A VOTE. Before the result of a vote has been finally and conclusively pronounced by the chair, but not thereafter, a member may change his or her vote; however, if a member&#39;s vote is erroneous, the member shall be allowed to change that vote at a later time provided:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the result of the record vote is not changed thereby;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the request is made known to the house by the chair and permission for the change is granted by unanimous consent; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a notation is made in the journal that the member&#39;s vote was changed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 54. TIE VOTE. All matters on which a vote may be taken by the house shall require for adoption a favorable affirmative vote as required by these rules, and in the case of a tie vote, the matter shall be considered lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 55. VERIFICATION OF A YEA AND NAY VOTE. When the result of a yea and nay vote is close, the speaker may on the request of any member order a verification vote, or the speaker may order a verification on his or her own initiative. During verification, no member shall change a vote unless it was erroneously recorded, nor may any member not having voted cast a vote; however, when the clerk errs in reporting the yeas and nays, and correction thereof leaves decisive effect to the speaker&#39;s vote, the speaker may exercise the right to vote, even though the result has been announced. A verification shall be called for immediately after the vote is announced. The speaker shall not entertain a request for verification after the house has proceeded to the next question, or after a recess or an adjournment. A vote to recess or adjourn, like any other proposition, may be verified. Only one vote verification can be pending at a time. A verification may be dispensed with by a two-thirds vote.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 56. VERIFICATION OF A REGISTRATION. The speaker may allow the verification of a registration (as differentiated from a record vote) if in the speaker&#39;s opinion there is serious doubt as to the presence of a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 57. MOTION FOR A CALL OF THE HOUSE PENDING VERIFICATION. A motion for a call of the house, and all incidental motions relating to it, shall be in order pending the verification of a vote. These motions must be made before the roll call on verification begins, and it shall not be in order to break into the roll call to make them.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 58. ERRONEOUS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE RESULT OF A VOTE. If, by an error of the voting clerk or reading clerk in reporting the yeas and nays from a registration or verification, the speaker announces a result different from that shown by the registration or verification, the status of the question shall be determined by the vote as actually recorded. If the vote is erroneously announced in such a way as to change the true result, all subsequent proceedings in connection therewith shall fail, and the journal shall be amended accordingly.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 6. ORDER OF BUSINESS AND CALENDARS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. DAILY ORDER OF BUSINESS. (a) When the house convenes on a new legislative day, the daily order of business shall be as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Call to order by speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Registration of members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Prayer by chaplain, unless the invocation has been given previously on the particular calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Pledge of allegiance to the United States flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) Excuses for absence of members and officers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) First reading and reference to committee of bills filed with the chief clerk; and motions to introduce bills, when such motions are required.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) Requests to print bills and other papers; requests of committees for further time to consider papers referred to them; and all other routine motions and business not otherwise provided for, all of which shall be undebatable except that the mover and one opponent of the motion shall be allowed three minutes each.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The mover of a routine motion shall be allowed his or her choice of making the opening or the closing speech under this rule. If the house, under a suspension of the rules, extends the time of a member under this rule, such extensions shall be for three minutes. Subsidiary motions that are applicable to routine motions shall be in order, but the makers of such subsidiary motions shall not be entitled to speak thereon in the routine motion period, nor shall the authors of the original routine motions be allowed any additional time because of subsidiary motions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) Unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10) Third reading calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(11) Postponed matters to be laid before the house in accordance with Rule 7, Section 15.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(12) Second reading calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When the house reconvenes for the first time on a new calendar day following a recess, the daily order of business shall be:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Call to order by the speaker.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Registration of members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Prayer by the chaplain.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Pledge of allegiance to the United States flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Pledge of allegiance to the Texas flag.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) Excuses for absence of members and officers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) Pending business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) Calendars of the house in their order of priority in accordance with Section 7 of this rule, unless a different order is determined under other provisions of these rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. SPECIAL ORDERS. (a) Any bill, resolution, or other measure may on any day be made a special order for the same day or for a future day of the session by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present. A motion to set a special order shall be subject to the three-minute pro and con debate rule. When once established as a special order, a bill, resolution, or other measure shall be considered from day to day until disposed of; and until it has been disposed of, no further special orders shall be made.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A three-fourths vote of the members present shall be required to suspend the portion of this rule which specifies that only one special order may be made and pending at a time.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first eight items under the daily order of business for a legislative day have been passed, a special order shall have precedence when the hour for its consideration has arrived, except as provided in Section 9 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) After the 115th day of a regular session, if a joint resolution has appeared on a daily house calendar and is adopted, and a bill that is enabling legislation for the joint resolution is either on or eligible to be placed on a calendar, the author or sponsor of the bill or another member may immediately be recognized for a motion to set the bill that is the enabling legislation as a special order pursuant to this section. For purposes of this subsection, the bill must have been designated as the enabling legislation for the joint resolution in writing filed with the chief clerk not later than the date the committee report for the enabling legislation is printed and distributed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. POSTPONEMENT OF A SPECIAL ORDER. A special order may be postponed to a day certain by a two-thirds vote of those present, and when so postponed, shall be considered as disposed of so far as its place as a special order is concerned.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. TABLED MEASURES AS SPECIAL ORDERS. A bill or resolution laid on the table subject to call may be made a special order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. SUBSTITUTION IN MOTION FOR A SPECIAL ORDER. When a motion is pending to set a particular bill or resolution as a special order, it shall not be in order to move as a substitute to set another bill or resolution as a special order. It shall be in order, however, to substitute, by majority vote, a different time for the special order consideration than that given in the original motion.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. MEMBER&#39;S SUSPENSION AND SPECIAL ORDER PRIVILEGES. If a member moves to set a bill or joint resolution as a special order, or moves to suspend the rules to take up a bill or joint resolution out of its regular order, and the motion prevails, the member shall not have the right to make either of these motions again until every other member has had an opportunity, via either of these motions, to have some bill or joint resolution considered out of its regular order during that session of the legislature. A member shall not lose the suspension privilege if the motion to suspend or set for special order does not prevail.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. SYSTEM OF CALENDARS. (a) Legislative business of the house shall be controlled by a system of calendars, consisting of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) EMERGENCY CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills considered to be of such pressing and imperative import as to demand immediate action, bills to raise revenue and levy taxes, and the general appropriations bill. A bill submitted as an emergency matter by the governor may also be placed on this calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) MAJOR STATE CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills of statewide effect, not emergency in nature, which establish or change state policy in a major field of governmental activity and which will have a major impact in application throughout the state without regard to class, area, or other limiting factors.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS CALENDAR, on which shall appear joint resolutions proposing amendments to the Texas Constitution, joint resolutions proposing the ratification of amendments to the Constitution of the United States, and joint resolutions applying to Congress for a convention to amend the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) GENERAL STATE CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills of statewide effect, not emergency in nature, which establish or change state law and which have application to all areas but are limited in legal effect by classification or other factors which minimize the impact to something less than major state policy, and bills, not emergency in nature, which are not on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear bills, house resolutions, and concurrent resolutions, not emergency in nature, regardless of extent and scope, on which there is such general agreement as to render improbable any opposition to the consideration and passage thereof, and which have been recommended by the appropriate standing committee for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear house resolutions and concurrent resolutions, not emergency in nature and not privileged.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR, on which shall appear congratulatory and memorial resolutions whose sole intent is to congratulate, memorialize, or otherwise express concern or commendation. The Committee on Resolutions Calendars may provide separate categories for congratulatory and memorial resolutions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A calendars committee shall strictly construe and the speaker shall strictly enforce this system of calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. SENATE BILL CALENDARS. (a) Senate bills and resolutions pending in the house shall follow the same procedure with regard to calendars as house bills and resolutions, but separate calendars shall be maintained for senate bills and resolutions, and consideration of them on senate bill days shall have priority in the manner and order specified in this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No other business shall be considered on days devoted to the consideration of senate bills when there remain any bills on any of the senate calendars, except with the consent of the senate. When all senate calendars are clear, the house may proceed to consideration of house calendars on senate bill days.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. SENATE BILL DAYS. (a) On calendar Wednesday and on calendar Thursday of each week, only senate bills and senate resolutions shall be taken up and considered, until disposed of. Senate bills and senate resolutions shall be considered in the order prescribed in Section 7 of this rule on separate senate calendars prepared by the Committee on Calendars. In case a senate bill or senate resolution is pending at adjournment on calendar Thursday, it shall go over to the succeeding calendar Wednesday as unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Precedence given in Rule 8 to certain classes of bills during the first 60 calendar days of a regular session shall also apply to senate bills on senate bill days.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10. CONSIDERATION OF SENATE BILL ON SAME SUBJECT. When any house bill is reached on the calendar or is before the house for consideration, it shall be the duty of the speaker to give the place on the calendar of the house bill to any senate bill containing the same subject that has been referred to and reported from a committee of the house and to lay the senate bill before the house, to be considered in lieu of the house bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11. PERIODS FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL CALENDARS. As the volume of legislation shall warrant, the chair of the Committee on Resolutions Calendars shall move to designate periods for the consideration of congratulatory and memorial calendars. Each such motion shall require a two-thirds vote for its adoption. In each instance, the Committee on Resolutions Calendars shall prepare and post on the electronic legislative information system a calendar at least 24 hours in advance of the hour set for consideration. No memorial or congratulatory resolution will be heard by the full house without having first been approved, at least 24 hours in advance, by a majority of the membership of the Committee on Resolutions Calendars, in accordance with Rule 4, Section 16. It shall not be necessary for the Committee on Resolutions Calendars to report a memorial or congratulatory resolution from committee in order to place the resolution on a congratulatory and memorial calendar. If the Committee on Resolutions Calendars determines that a resolution is not eligible for placement on the congratulatory and memorial calendar the measure shall be sent to the Committee on Calendars for further action. A congratulatory and memorial calendar will contain the resolution number, the author&#39;s name, and a brief description of the intent of the resolution. On the congratulatory and memorial calendar, congratulatory resolutions may be listed separately from memorial resolutions. Once a calendar is posted, no additional resolutions will be added to it, and the requirements of this section shall not be subject to suspension.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONGRATULATORY AND MEMORIAL CALENDARS. During the consideration of a congratulatory and memorial calendar, resolutions shall not be read in full unless they pertain to members or former members of the legislature, or unless the intended recipient of the resolution is present on the house floor or in the gallery. All other such resolutions shall be read only by number, type of resolution, and name of the person or persons designated in the resolutions. Members shall notify the chair, in advance of consideration of the calendar, of any resolutions that will be required to be read in full. In addition, the following procedures shall be observed:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) The chair shall recognize the reading clerk to read the resolutions within each category on the calendar only by number, type of resolution, author or sponsor, and name of the person or persons designated in the resolutions, except for those resolutions that have been withdrawn or that are required to be read in full. The resolutions read by the clerk shall then be adopted in one motion for each category.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Subsequent to the adoption of the resolutions read by the clerk, the chair shall proceed to lay before the house the resolutions on the calendar that are required to be read in full. Each such resolution shall be read and adopted individually.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If it develops that any resolution on the congratulatory and memorial calendar does not belong on that calendar, the chair shall withdraw the resolution from further consideration, remove it from the calendar, and refer it to the appropriate calendars committee for placement on the proper calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. PERIODS FOR CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDARS. (a) As the volume of legislation shall warrant, the chair of the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall move to designate periods for the consideration of local, consent, and resolutions calendars. Each such motion shall require a two-thirds vote for its adoption. In each instance, the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall prepare and post on the electronic legislative information system a calendar at least 48 hours in advance of the hour set for consideration. Once a calendar is posted, no additional bills or resolutions will be added to it. This requirement can be suspended only by unanimous consent. No local, consent, and resolutions calendar may be considered by the house if it is determined that the rules of the house were not complied with by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars in preparing that calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The period designated for the consideration of a local, consent, and resolutions calendar under this section or under a special order under Section 2 of this rule may not exceed one calendar day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 14. PROCEDURE FOR CONSIDERATION OF LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDARS. During the consideration of a local, consent, and resolutions calendar set by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars the following procedures shall be observed:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) The chair shall allow the sponsor of each bill or resolution three minutes to explain the measure, and the time shall not be extended except by unanimous consent of the house. This rule shall have precedence over all other rules limiting time for debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If it develops that any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar is to be contested on the floor of the house under Subdivision (3) or (4) of this section, the chair shall withdraw the bill or resolution from further consideration and remove it from the calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar shall be considered contested if notice is given by five or more members present in the house under Rule 5, Section 45, that they intend to oppose the bill or resolution, either by a raising of hands or the delivery of written notice to the chair.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar shall be considered contested if debate exceeds 10 minutes, after the chair lays out the bill or resolution following the sponsor&#39;s explanation under Subdivision (1) of this section. The chair shall strictly enforce this time limit and automatically withdraw the bill from further consideration if the time limit herein imposed is exceeded.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Any bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar that is not reached for floor consideration because of the expiration of the calendar day period for consideration established by Section 13 of this rule shall carry over onto the next local, consent, and resolutions calendar. Bills or resolutions that carry over must appear in the same relative order as on the calendar on which the bills or resolutions initially appeared, and bills or resolutions originally from older calendars must appear before those originally from more recent calendars.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) A motion to postpone a bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar to a subsequent legislative or calendar day requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 15. ORDER OF CONSIDERATION OF CALENDARS. Except for local, consent, and resolutions calendars and congratulatory and memorial calendars, consideration of calendars shall be in the order named in Section 7 of this rule, subject to any exceptions ordered by the Committee on Calendars. Bills and resolutions on third reading shall have precedence over bills and resolutions on second reading.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 16. DAILY CALENDARS, SUPPLEMENTAL CALENDARS, AND LISTS OF ITEMS ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION. (a) Calendars shall be prepared daily when the house is in session. A calendar must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least 36 hours if convened in regular session and 24 hours if convened in special session before the calendar may be considered by the house, except as otherwise provided by these rules for the calendar on which the general appropriations bill is first eligible for consideration on second reading when convened in regular session. A calendar that contains a bill extending an agency, commission, or advisory committee under the Texas Sunset Act must be posted at least 48 hours if convened in regular or special session before the calendar may be considered by the house. Deviations from the calendars as posted shall not be permitted except that the Committee on Calendars shall be authorized to prepare and post, not later than two hours before the house convenes, a supplemental daily house calendar, on which shall appear:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) bills or resolutions which were passed to third reading on the previous legislative day, except as provided by Section 24(b) of this rule;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) bills or resolutions which appeared on the Daily House Calendar for a previous calendar day which were not reached for floor consideration;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) postponed business from a previous calendar day; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) notice to take from the table a bill or resolution which was laid on the table subject to call on a previous legislative day.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the items listed above, the bills and resolutions from a daily house calendar that will be eligible for consideration may be incorporated, in their proper order as determined by these rules, into the supplemental daily house calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a-1) If the house is convened in regular session, the calendar on which the general appropriations bill is first eligible for consideration on second reading must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least 144 hours before the calendar may be considered by the house. The posted calendar must indicate the date and time at which the calendar is scheduled for consideration by the house, which date and time must be in accordance with Rule 8, Section 14.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) In addition, when the volume of legislation shall warrant, and upon request of the speaker, the chief clerk shall have prepared a list of Items Eligible for Consideration, on which shall appear only:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) house bills with senate amendments that are eligible for consideration under Rule 13, Section 5, including the number of senate amendments and the total number of pages of senate amendments;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) senate bills for which the senate has requested appointment of a conference committee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) conference committee reports that are eligible for consideration under Rule 13, Section 10.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The list of Items Eligible for Consideration must be posted on the electronic legislative information system at least six hours before the list may be considered by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The time at which a calendar or list is posted on the electronic legislative information system shall be time-stamped on the originals of the calendar or list.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) No house calendar shall be eligible for consideration if it is determined that the rules of the house were not complied with by the Committee on Calendars in preparing that calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) If the Committee on Calendars has proposed a rule for floor consideration of a bill or resolution that is eligible to be placed on a calendar of the daily house calendar, the rule must be printed and a copy distributed to each member. If the bill or resolution to which the rule will apply has already been placed on a calendar of the daily house calendar, a copy of the rule must also be posted with the calendar on which the bill or resolution appears. The speaker shall lay a proposed rule before the house prior to the consideration of the bill or resolution to which the rule will apply. The rule shall be laid before the house not earlier than six hours after a copy of the rule has been distributed to each member in accordance with this subsection. The rule shall not be subject to amendment, but to be effective, the rule must be approved by the house by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of those members present and voting, except that the rule must be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of those members present and voting if the rule applies to a tax bill, an appropriations bill, or a redistricting bill. If approved by the house in accordance with this subsection, the rule will be effective for the consideration of the bill or resolution on both second and third readings.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. POSITION ON A CALENDAR. (a) Unless removed from the calendar under Subsection (b) of this section, once a bill or resolution is placed on its appropriate calendar under these rules, and has appeared on a house calendar, as posted on the electronic legislative information system, the bill shall retain its relative position on the calendar until reached for floor consideration, and the calendars committee with jurisdiction over the bill or resolution shall have no authority to place other bills on the calendar ahead of that bill, but all additions to the calendar shall appear subsequent to the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If a bill or resolution that has been placed on a house calendar, as posted on the electronic legislative information system, is recommitted or withdrawn from further consideration, the bill or resolution relinquishes its position on the calendar, and the bill or resolution shall be removed from the calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 18. REQUIREMENTS FOR PLACEMENT ON A CALENDAR. Except as provided in Section 11 of this rule as it relates to congratulatory and memorial resolutions, no bill or resolution shall be placed on a calendar until:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) it has been referred to and reported from its appropriate standing committee by favorable committee action; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) it is ordered printed on minority report or after a committee has reported its inability to recommend a course of action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 19. REFERRAL TO CALENDARS COMMITTEES. All bills and resolutions, on being reported from committee, shall be referred immediately to the committee coordinator for printing and then to the appropriate calendars committee for placement on the appropriate calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 20. TIME LIMIT FOR VOTE TO PLACE ON A CALENDAR. Within 30 calendar days after a bill or resolution has been referred to the appropriate calendars committee, the committee must vote on whether to place the bill or resolution on one of the calendars of the daily house calendar or the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, as applicable. A vote against placement of the bill or resolution on a calendar does not preclude a calendars committee from later voting in favor of placement of the bill or resolution on a calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 21. MOTION TO PLACE ON A CALENDAR. (a) When a bill or resolution has been in the appropriate calendars committee for 30 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, awaiting placement on one of the calendars of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, it shall be in order for a member to move that the bill or resolution be placed on a specific calendar of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar without action by the committee. This motion must be seconded by five members and shall require a majority vote for adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to place a bill or resolution on a specific calendar of the daily house calendar or on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. REQUEST FOR PLACEMENT ON LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR. No bill or resolution shall be considered for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars unless a request for that placement has been made to the chair of the standing committee from which the bill or resolution was reported and unless the committee report of the standing committee recommends that the bill or resolution be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar. The recommendation of the standing committee shall be advisory only, and the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars shall have final authority to determine whether or not a bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar. If the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars determines that the bill or resolution is not eligible for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, the measure shall be sent to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. QUALIFICATIONS FOR PLACEMENT ON THE LOCAL, CONSENT, AND RESOLUTIONS CALENDAR. (a) No bill defined as a local bill by Rule 8, Section 10(c), shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar unless:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) evidence of publication of notice in compliance with the Texas Constitution and these rules is filed with the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) it has been recommended unanimously by the present and voting members of the committee from which it was reported that the bill be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) No other bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar unless it has been recommended unanimously by the present and voting members of the committee from which it was reported that the bill be sent to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for placement on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) No bill or resolution shall be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) directly or indirectly prevents from being available for purposes of funding state government generally any money that under existing law would otherwise be available for that purpose, including a bill that transfers or diverts money in the state treasury from the general revenue fund to another fund; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) authorizes or requires the expenditure or diversion of state funds for any purpose, as determined by a fiscal note attached to the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. REPLACEMENT OF CONTESTED BILLS AND RESOLUTIONS. (a) A bill on second reading or a resolution once removed from the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by being contested on the floor of the house under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule shall be returned to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for further action. The Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, if it feels such action is warranted, may again place the bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar, provided, however, that if the bill or resolution is not placed on the next local, consent, and resolutions calendar set by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, the bill or resolution shall immediately be referred to the Committee on Calendars for further action. If a bill on second reading or a resolution is then removed from the calendar a second time by being contested on the floor of the house under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule, the bill or resolution shall not again be placed on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar by the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars during that session of the legislature but shall be returned to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A bill on third reading removed from the local, consent, and resolutions calendar under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule shall appear on the supplemental daily house calendar for the next legislative day for which a supplemental daily house calendar has not already been distributed, pursuant to Section 16(a)(1) of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) This section does not apply to a bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar that is withdrawn from the calendar at the request of the author or sponsor without being contested under Section 14(3) or (4) of this rule. A bill or resolution withdrawn under this subsection shall be returned to the Committee on Local and Consent Calendars for further action. The Committee on Local and Consent Calendars, if it feels such action is warranted, may again place the bill or resolution on the local, consent, and resolutions calendar or refer the bill or resolution to the Committee on Calendars for further action.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. DISCRETION IN PLACEMENT ON CALENDARS. Subject to the limitations contained in this rule, the Committee on Calendars shall have full authority to make placements on calendars in whatever order is necessary and desirable under the circumstances then existing, except that bills on third reading shall have precedence over bills on second reading. It is the intent of the calendar system to give the Committee on Calendars wide discretion to insure adequate consideration by the house of important legislation.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 7.

ADJOURNING WITH LESS THAN A QUORUM. A smaller number of members than a quorum may adjourn from day to day, and may compel the attendance of absent members.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. MOTION TO TABLE. A motion to lay on the table, if carried, shall have the effect of killing the bill, resolution, amendment, or other immediate proposition to which it was applied. Such a motion shall not be debatable, but the mover of the proposition to be tabled, or the member reporting it from committee, shall be allowed to close the debate after the motion to table is made and before it is put to a vote. When a motion to table is made to a debatable main motion, the main motion mover shall be allowed 20 minutes to close the debate, whereas the movers of other debatable motions sought to be tabled shall be allowed only 10 minutes to close. The vote by which a motion to table is carried or lost cannot be reconsidered. After the previous question has been ordered, a motion to table is not in order. The provisions of this section do not apply to motions to &quot;lay on the table subject to call&quot;; however, a motion to lay on the table subject to call cannot be made after the previous question has been ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. MATTERS TABLED SUBJECT TO CALL. When a bill, resolution, or other matter is pending before the house, it may be laid on the table subject to call, and one legislative day&#39;s notice, as provided on the Supplemental House Calendar, must be given before the proposition can be taken from the table, unless it is on the same legislative day, in which case it can be taken from the table at any time except when there is another matter pending before the house. A bill, resolution, or other matter can be taken from the table only by a majority vote of the house. When a special order is pending, a motion to take a proposition from the table cannot be made unless the proposition is a privileged matter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 14. MOTION TO POSTPONE. (a) A motion to postpone to a day certain may be amended and is debatable within narrow limits, but the merits of the proposition sought to be postponed cannot be debated. A motion to postpone indefinitely opens to debate the entire proposition to which it applies.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to postpone a bill or resolution on a local, consent, and resolutions calendar to a subsequent legislative or calendar day requires an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 15. POSTPONED MATTERS. A bill or proposition postponed to a day certain shall be laid before the house at the time on the calendar day to which it was postponed, provided it is otherwise eligible under the rules and no other business is then pending. If business is pending, the postponed matter shall be deferred until the pending business is disposed of without prejudice otherwise to its right of priority. When a privileged matter is postponed to a particular time, and that time arrives, the matter, still retaining its privileged nature, shall be taken up even though another matter is pending.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 16. ORDER OF CONSIDERATION OF POSTPONED MATTERS. If two or more bills, resolutions, or other propositions are postponed to the same time, and are otherwise eligible for consideration at that time, they shall be considered in the chronological order of their setting.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. MOTION TO REFER. When motions are made to refer a subject to a select or standing committee, the question on the subject&#39;s referral to a standing committee shall be put first.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 18. MOTION TO RECOMMIT. A motion to recommit a bill, after being defeated at the routine motion period, may again be made when the bill itself is under consideration; however, a motion to recommit a bill shall not be in order at the routine motion period if the bill is then before the house as either pending business or unfinished business.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A motion to recommit a bill or resolution can be made and voted on even though the author, sponsor, or principal proponent is not present.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 19. TERMS OF DEBATE ON MOTIONS TO REFER, REREFER, COMMIT, OR RECOMMIT. A motion to refer, rerefer, commit, or recommit is debatable within narrow limits, but the merits of the proposition may not be brought into the debate. A motion to refer, rerefer, commit, or recommit with instructions is fully debatable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 20. RECOMMITTING TO COMMITTEE FOR A SECOND TIME. Except as provided in Rule 4, Section 30, when a bill has been recommitted once at any reading and has been reported adversely by the committee to which it was referred, it shall be in order to again recommit the bill only if a minority report has been filed in the time required by the rules of the house. A two-thirds vote of those present shall be required to recommit a second time.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER B. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 21. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. There shall be a motion for the previous question, which shall be admitted only when seconded by 25 members. It shall be put by the chair in this manner: &quot;The motion has been seconded. Three minutes pro and con debate will be allowed on the motion for ordering the previous question.&quot; As soon as the debate has ended, the chair shall continue: &quot;As many as are in favor of ordering the previous question on (here state on which question or questions) will say &#39;Aye,&#39;&quot; and then, &quot;As many as are opposed say &#39;Nay.&#39;&quot; As in all other propositions, a motion for the previous question may be taken by a record vote if demanded by any member. If ordered by a majority of the members voting, a quorum being present, it shall have the effect of cutting off all debate, except as provided in Section 23 of this rule, and bringing the house to a direct vote on the immediate question or questions on which it has been asked and ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 22. DEBATE ON MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION. On the motion for the previous question, there shall be no debate except as provided in Sections 2 and 21 of this rule. All incidental questions of order made pending decision on such motion shall be decided, whether on appeal or otherwise, without debate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 23. LIMITATION OF DEBATE AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. After the previous question has been ordered, there shall be no debate upon the questions on which it has been ordered, or upon the incidental questions, except that the mover of the proposition or any of the pending amendments or any other motions, or the member making the report from the committee, or, in the case of the absence of either of them, any other member designated by such absentee, shall have the right to close the debate on the particular proposition or amendment. Then a vote shall be taken immediately on the amendments or other motions, if any, and then on the main question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 24. SPEAKING AND VOTING AFTER THE PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. All members having the right to speak after the previous question has been ordered shall speak before the question is put on the first proposition covered by the previous question. All votes shall then be taken in the correct order, and no vote or votes shall be deferred to allow any member to close on any one of the propositions separately after the voting has commenced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 25. SPEAKING ON AN AMENDMENT AS SUBSTITUTED. When an amendment has been substituted and the previous question is then moved on the adoption of the amendment as substituted, the author of the amendment as substituted shall have the right to close the debate on that amendment in lieu of the author of the original amendment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 26. SPEAKING ON A MOTION TO POSTPONE OR AMEND. When the previous question is ordered on a motion to postpone indefinitely or to amend by striking out the enacting clause of a bill, the member moving to postpone or amend shall have the right to close the debate on that motion or amendment, after which the mover of the proposition or bill proposed to be so postponed or amended, or the member reporting it from the committee, or, in the absence of either of them, any other member designated by the absentee, shall be allowed to close the debate on the original proposition.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 27. APPLICATION OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. The previous question may be asked and ordered on any debatable single motion or series of motions, or any amendment or amendments pending, or it may be made to embrace all authorized debatable motions or amendments pending and include the bill, resolution, or proposition that is on second or third reading. The previous question cannot be ordered, however, on the main proposition without including other pending motions of lower rank as given in Section 3 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 28. LIMIT OF APPLICATION. The previous question shall not extend beyond the final vote on a motion or sequence of motions to which the previous question has been ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 29. AMENDMENTS NOT YET LAID BEFORE THE HOUSE. Amendments on the speaker&#39;s desk for consideration which have not actually been laid before the house and read cannot be included under a motion for the previous question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 30. MOVING THE PREVIOUS QUESTION AFTER A MOTION TO TABLE. If a motion to table is made directly to a main motion, the motion for the previous question is not in order. In a case where an amendment to a main motion is pending, and a motion to table the amendment is made, it is in order to move the previous question on the main motion, the pending amendment, and the motion to table the amendment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 31. NO SUBSTITUTE FOR MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. There is no acceptable substitute for a motion for the previous question, nor can other motions be applied to it.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 32. MOTION FOR THE PREVIOUS QUESTION NOT SUBJECT TO TABLING. The motion for the previous question is not subject to a motion to table.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 33. MOTION TO ADJOURN AFTER MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION ACCEPTED. The motion to adjourn is not in order after a motion for the previous question is accepted by the chair, or after the seconding of such motion and before a vote is taken.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 34. MOTIONS IN ORDER AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. After the previous question has been ordered, no motion shall be in order until the question or questions on which it was ordered have been voted on, without debate, except:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a motion for a call of the house, and motions incidental thereto;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a motion to extend the time of a member closing on a proposition;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a motion to permit a member who has the right to speak to yield the time or a part thereof to another member;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) a request for and a verification of a vote;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a motion to reconsider the vote by which the previous question was ordered. A motion to reconsider may be made only once and that must be before any vote under the previous question has been taken;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) a motion to table a motion to reconsider the vote by which the previous question has been ordered;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) a double motion to reconsider and table the vote by which the previous question was ordered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 35. MOTION TO ADJOURN OR RECESS AFTER PREVIOUS QUESTION ORDERED. No motion for an adjournment or a recess shall be in order after the previous question is ordered until the final vote under the previous question has been taken, unless the roll call shows the absence of a quorum.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 36. ADJOURNING WITHOUT A QUORUM. When the house adjourns without a quorum under the previous question, the previous question shall remain in force and effect when the bill, resolution, or other proposition is again laid before the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER C. RECONSIDERATION</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 37. MOTION TO RECONSIDER A VOTE. (a) When a question has been decided by the house and the yeas and nays have been called for and recorded, any member voting with the prevailing side may, on the same legislative day, or on the next legislative day, move a reconsideration; however, if a reconsideration is moved on the next legislative day, it must be done before the order of the day, as designated in the 10th item of Rule 6, Section 1(a), is taken up. If the house refuses to reconsider, or on reconsideration, affirms its decision, no further action to reconsider shall be in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Where the yeas and nays have not been called for and recorded, any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, may make the motion to reconsider; however, even when the yeas and nays have not been recorded, the following shall not be eligible to make a motion to reconsider:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a member who was absent;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a member who was paired and, therefore, did not vote; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a member who was recorded in the journal as having voted on the losing side.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Except as otherwise provided by this subsection, a motion to reconsider the vote by which a bill, joint resolution, or concurrent resolution was defeated is not in order unless a member has previously provided at least one hour&#39;s notice of intent to make the motion by addressing the house when the house is in session and stating that a member intends to make a motion to reconsider the vote by which the bill or resolution was defeated. It is not necessary for the member providing the notice to be eligible to make or to be the member who subsequently makes the motion to reconsider. If notice of intent to make a motion to reconsider is given within the period that the motion to reconsider may be made under Subsection (a) of this section and that period expires during the one-hour period required by this subsection, then the period within which the motion may be made under Subsection (a) is extended by the amount of time, not to exceed one hour during which the house is in session, necessary to satisfy the one-hour notice required by this subsection. This subsection does not apply to a motion to reconsider and table or to a motion to reconsider and spread on the journal, if no business has been transacted after the defeat of the measure.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 38. DEBATE ON MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider shall be debatable only when the question to be reconsidered is debatable. Even though the previous question was in force before the vote on a debatable question was taken, debate is permissible on the reconsideration of such debatable question.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 39. MAJORITY VOTE REQUIRED. Every motion to reconsider shall be decided by a majority vote, even though the vote on the original question requires a two-thirds vote for affirmative action. If the motion to reconsider prevails, the question then immediately recurs on the question reconsidered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 40. WITHDRAWAL OF MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider cannot be withdrawn unless permission is given by a majority vote of the house, and the motion may be called up by any member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 41. TABLING MOTION TO RECONSIDER. A motion to reconsider shall be subject to a motion to table, which, if carried, shall be a final disposition of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 42. DOUBLE MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND TABLE. The double motion to reconsider and table shall be in order. It shall be undebatable. When carried, the motion to reconsider shall be tabled. When it fails, the question shall then be on the motion to reconsider, and the motion to reconsider shall, without further action, be spread on the journal, but it may be called up by any member, in accordance with the provisions of Section 43 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 43. DELAYED DISPOSITION OF MOTION TO RECONSIDER. (a) If a motion to reconsider is not disposed of when made, it shall be entered in the journal, and cannot, after that legislative day, be called up and disposed of unless one legislative day&#39;s notice has been given.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Unless called up and disposed of prior to 72 hours before final adjournment of the session, all motions to reconsider shall be regarded as determined and lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) All motions to reconsider made during the last 72 hours of the session shall be disposed of when made; otherwise, the motion shall be considered as lost.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 44. MOTION TO RECONSIDER AND SPREAD ON JOURNAL. (a) A member voting on the prevailing side may make a motion to reconsider and spread on the journal, which does not require a vote, and on the motion being made, it shall be entered on the journal. Any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, who desires immediate action on a motion to reconsider which has been spread on the journal, can call it up as soon as it is made, and demand a vote on it, or can call it up and move to table it.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If the motion to table the motion to reconsider is defeated, the motion to reconsider remains spread on the journal for future action; however, any member, regardless of whether he or she voted on the prevailing side or not, can call the motion from the journal for action by the house, and, once disposed of, no other motion to reconsider can be made.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 45. MOTION TO REQUIRE COMMITTEE TO REPORT. (a) During the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 6 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, it shall be in order for a member to move that the committee be required to report the same within 7 calendar days. This motion shall require a two-thirds vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 6 calendar days, exclusive of the calendar day on which it was referred, it shall be in order for a member to move that the committee be required to report the same within 7 calendar days. This motion shall require a majority vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A motion to instruct a committee to report is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The house shall have no authority to instruct a subcommittee directly; however, instructions recognized under the rules may be given to a committee and shall be binding on all subcommittees.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 46. MOTION TO REREFER TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE. (a) During the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 7 calendar days after the committee was instructed by the house to report that measure by a motion made under Section 45 of this rule, it shall be in order for a member to move to rerefer the bill, resolution, or other paper to a different committee. This motion shall require a two-thirds vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) After the first 76 calendar days of a regular session, when any bill, resolution, or other paper has been in committee for 7 calendar days after the committee has been instructed to report that measure by a motion made under Section 45 of this rule, it shall be in order for a member to move to rerefer the bill, resolution, or other paper to a different committee. This motion shall require a majority vote for passage.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) A motion to rerefer a bill, resolution, or other paper from one committee to another committee is not a privileged motion and must be made during the routine motion period unless made under a suspension of the rules.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 8. BILLS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. CONTENTS OF BILLS.

PUBLISHING ACTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY. No law shall be revived or amended by reference to its title. The act revived, or the section or sections amended, shall be reenacted and published at length. This rule does not apply to revisions adopted under Article III, Section 43, of the Texas Constitution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. LIMITING A BILL TO A SINGLE SUBJECT.

The signatures of all coauthors or joint authors shall appear on the appropriate forms in the chief clerk&#39;s office.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Any member may become the coauthor of a bill or resolution by securing permission from the author. If permission is secured from the author prior to the time the measure is filed with the chief clerk, the primary author and the coauthor shall sign the appropriate form, which shall be included with the measure when it is filed with the chief clerk. If a member wishes to become the coauthor of a measure after it has been filed, no action shall be required by the house, but it shall be the duty of the member seeking to be a coauthor to obtain written authorization on the appropriate form from the author. This authorization shall be filed with the chief clerk before the coauthor signs the form for the bill or resolution. The chief clerk shall report daily to the journal clerk the names of members filed as coauthors of bills or resolutions. If a coauthor of a bill or resolution desires to withdraw from such status, the member shall notify the chief clerk, who in turn shall notify the journal clerk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The primary author of a measure may designate up to four joint authors by providing written authorization on the appropriate form to the chief clerk.

The chair of the committee must designate a primary sponsor and may designate up to four joint sponsors or an unlimited number of cosponsors. The names of all joint sponsors shall be shown immediately following the primary sponsor&#39;s name on all official printings of the measure, on all house calendars, in the house journal, and in the electronic legislative information system.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. FILING, FIRST READING, AND REFERRAL TO COMMITTEE. Each bill shall be filed with the chief clerk when introduced and shall be numbered in its regular order.

On receipt of the bills or resolutions, the chief clerk shall number them and make them a matter of public record, available for distribution. Once a bill or resolution has been so filed, it may not be recalled. This shall apply only to members-elect of the succeeding legislative session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. DEADLINE FOR INTRODUCTION. (a) Bills and joint resolutions introduced during the first 60 calendar days of the regular session may be considered by the committees and in the house and disposed of at any time during the session, in accordance with the rules of the house.

FILING. (a) A bill must be filed with the chief clerk in the manner and in an electronic or other format specified by the chief clerk at the time that the bill is introduced.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A bill relating to conservation and reclamation districts and governed by the provisions of Article XVI, Section 59, of the Texas Constitution must be filed with copies of the notice to introduce the bill attached if the bill is intended to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) create a particular conservation and reclamation district; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) amend the act of a particular conservation and reclamation district to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) add additional land to the district;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) alter the taxing authority of the district;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) alter the authority of the district with respect to issuing bonds; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) alter the qualifications or terms of office of the members of the governing body of the district.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10.

However, this subsection does not prevent consideration of a bill that classifies political subdivisions according to a minimum or maximum population or other criterion that bears a reasonable relation to the purpose of the proposed legislation or a bill that updates laws based on population classifications to conform to a federal decennial census.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Except as provided by Subsection (d) of this section, &quot;local bill&quot; for purposes of this section means:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a bill for which publication of notice is required under Article XVI, Section 59, of the Texas Constitution (water districts, etc.);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) a bill for which publication of notice is required under Article IX, Section 9, of the Texas Constitution (hospital districts);</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) a bill relating to hunting, fishing, or conservation of wildlife resources of a specified locality;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) a bill creating or affecting a county court or statutory court or courts of one or more specified counties or municipalities;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a bill creating or affecting the juvenile board or boards of a specified county or counties; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) a bill creating or affecting a road utility district under the authority of Article III, Section 52, of the Texas Constitution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) A bill is not considered to be a local bill under Subsection (c)(3), (4), or (5) if it affects a sufficient number of localities, counties, or municipalities so as to be of general application or of statewide importance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11.

However, after each section or department has been considered separately, the entire bill or resolution shall be open for amendment, subject to the provisions of Rule 11, Section 8(b). Once the consideration of a bill section by section or department by department has been ordered, it shall not be in order to move the previous question on the entire bill, to recommit it, to lay it on the table, or to postpone it, until each section or department has been given separate consideration or until the vote by which section by section consideration was ordered is reconsidered.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A motion to consider a bill section by section is debatable within narrow limits; that is, the pros and cons of the proposed consideration can be debated but not the merits of the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 17. PASSAGE TO ENGROSSMENT OR THIRD READING. After a bill or complete committee substitute for a bill has been taken up and read, amendments shall be in order.

The speaker shall note on each bill the date and hour of final legislative action and shall withhold his or her signature and any further action on all such bills until the general appropriations bill has been signed by the presiding officers of both houses and transmitted to the comptroller of public accounts for certification. Immediately thereafter, the speaker shall sign in the presence of the house all bills on which further action was being withheld because the bills were subject to the provisions of this section. After being signed by the speaker, the bills shall then be transmitted to the comptroller of public accounts for certification or to the governor, as the case may be, in the order in which final legislative action was taken. &quot;Final legislative action,&quot; as that term is used in this subsection, shall mean the last act of either house meeting in general session necessary to place the bill in its final form preparatory to enrollment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Subsections (a)-(d) of this section shall not apply to any bills providing for:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the payment of expenses of the legislature;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the payment of judgments against the state;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) any emergency matter when requested by the governor in a formal message to the legislature; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the reduction of taxes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e-1) Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a bill that prevents the deposit into the general revenue fund of money received from the federal government or earnings on that money if the bill does not prevent that money from being available for the purpose of funding state government generally to the same extent as under existing law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Unless within the authority of a resolution or resolutions adopted pursuant to Article VIII, Section 22(b), of the Texas Constitution, it is not in order for the house to consider for final passage on third reading, on motion to concur in senate amendments, or on motion to adopt a conference committee report, a bill appropriating funds from the state treasury in an amount that, when added to amounts previously appropriated by bills finally passed and sent or due to be sent to the comptroller, would exceed the limit on appropriations established under Chapter 316, Government Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The general appropriations bill shall be reported to the house by the Committee on Appropriations not later than the 90th calendar day of the regular session. Should the Committee on Appropriations fail to report by the deadline, Subsections (a)-(d) of this section shall be suspended for the balance of that regular session.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 9.

If such a joint resolution receives only a majority vote on second reading, it shall be passed to engrossment, and subsequent proceedings shall be the same as those governing the final passage of bills which have been passed to engrossment. If such a joint resolution does not receive a two-thirds vote of the elected membership of the house on third reading and final passage, it shall fail of adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2.

AMENDMENTS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. ACCEPTABLE MOTIONS TO AMEND. When a bill, resolution, motion, or proposition is under consideration, a motion to amend and a motion to amend that amendment shall be in order.

Except for matter to be printed in the journal, all requirements contained in the rules with respect to the printing of bills, resolutions, reports, and other matters shall be considered complied with if the material is adequately and properly reproduced by any acceptable means of reproduction.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 13. INTERACTIONS WITH THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER A. MESSAGES</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. MESSAGES FROM THE GOVERNOR.

(a) Senate amendments to house bills and resolutions must be printed and copies provided to the members at least 24 hours before any action can be taken thereon by the house during a regular or special session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) When a house bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, with senate amendments is returned to the house, the chief clerk shall request the Legislative Budget Board to prepare a fiscal note outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the measure as impacted by the senate amendments. A copy of the fiscal note shall be distributed with the senate amendments on their printing before any action can be taken on the senate amendments by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) When a house bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, with senate amendments is returned to the house, the chief clerk shall request the Texas Legislative Council to prepare an analysis that describes the substantive changes made to the house version of the bill by the senate amendments. A copy of the council&#39;s analysis of senate amendments shall be provided to the members electronically or as a printed copy at least 12 hours before action is taken on the senate amendments by the house. The Texas Legislative Council shall make all reasonable efforts to timely provide the analysis in as accurate a form as time allows. However, an unavoidable inability to provide the analysis or an inadvertent error in the analysis is not subject to a point of order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) When a house bill or joint resolution for which a tax equity note was required under Rule 4, Section 34(b)(5), is returned to the house with senate amendments, the chief clerk shall request the Legislative Budget Board to prepare a tax equity note estimating the general effects of the senate amendments on the distribution of tax and fee burdens among individuals and businesses. A copy of the updated tax equity note shall be made available to each member, in some format, before any vote on the floor can be taken on the senate amendments by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER C.

Failure to comply with this subsection is not subject to a point of order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 7. MEETINGS. (a) House conferees when meeting with senate conferees to adjust differences shall meet in public and shall give a reasonable amount of notice of the meeting in the place designated for giving notice of meetings of house standing committees. Any such meeting shall be open to the news media. Any conference committee report adopted in private shall not be considered by the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) At a meeting of the conferees to adjust differences on the general appropriations bill, the chair of the house conferees may request the assistance of any house member who serves on the appropriations committee.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 8. INSTRUCTIONS. Instructions to a conference committee shall be made after the conference is ordered and before the conferees are appointed by the speaker, and not thereafter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 9. LIMITATIONS ON JURISDICTION. (a) Conference committees shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. A conference committee shall have no authority with respect to any bill or resolution:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) to change, alter, or amend text which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) to omit text which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) to add text on any matter which is not in disagreement;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) to add text on any matter which is not included in either the house or senate version of the bill or resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Conference committees on appropriations bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on appropriations bills shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and in identical amounts, no change can be made in the item or the amount.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but in different amounts, no change can be made in the item, but the amount shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that the amount shall not exceed the larger version and shall not be less than the smaller version.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) If an item of appropriation appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee. If the item is included, the amount shall not exceed the sum specified in the version containing the item.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If an item of appropriation appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report. However, the conference committee report may include appropriations for purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed and sent to the governor and may include contingent appropriations for purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed by at least one house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Conference committees on tax bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on a tax bill shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and in identical form and with identical rates, no change can be made in the item or the rate provided.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but at differing rates, no change can be made in the item, but the rate shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that the rate shall not exceed the higher version and shall not be less than the lower version.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) If a tax item appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee. If the item is included, the rate shall not exceed the rate specified in the version containing the item.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If a tax item appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house to achieve these purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Conference committees on reapportionment bills, to the extent possible, shall limit their discussions and their actions to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. Since the adjustment of one district in a reapportionment bill will inevitably affect other districts, the strict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees must be relaxed somewhat when reapportionment bills are involved. Accordingly, the following authority and limitations shall apply only to conference committees on reapportionment bills:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If the matters in disagreement affect only certain districts, and other districts are identical in both house and senate versions of the bill, the conference committee shall make adjustments only in those districts whose rearrangement is essential to the effective resolving of the matters in disagreement. All other districts shall remain unchanged.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If the matters in disagreement permeate the entire bill and affect most, if not all, of the districts, the conference committee shall have wide discretion in rearranging the districts to the extent necessary to resolve all differences between the two houses.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Insofar as the actual structure of the districts is concerned, and only to that extent, the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to conference committees on reapportionment bills.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Conference committees on recodification bills, like other conference committees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement between the two houses. The comprehensive and complicated nature of recodification bills makes necessary the relaxing of the strict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees only to the following extent:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) If it develops in conference committee that material has been inadvertently included in both house and senate versions which properly has no place in the recodification, that material may be omitted from the conference committee report, if by that omission the existing statute is not repealed, altered, or amended.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) If it develops in conference committee that material has been inadvertently omitted from both the house and senate versions which properly should be included if the recodification is to achieve its purpose of being all-inclusive of the statutes being recodified, that material may be added to the conference committee report, if by the addition the existing statute is merely restated without substantive change in existing law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Limitations imposed on certain conference committees by the provisions of this section may be suspended in part by permission of the house to allow consideration of and action on a specific matter or matters which otherwise would be prohibited. Permission shall be granted only by resolution passed by majority vote of the house. All such resolutions shall be privileged in nature and need not be referred to a committee. The introduction of such a resolution shall be announced from the house floor and the resolution shall be eligible for consideration by the house:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) three hours after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each member; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) for a resolution suspending limitations on a conference committee considering the general appropriations bill, 48 hours in a regular session and 24 hours in a special session after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) The time at which the copies of such a resolution are distributed to the members shall be time-stamped on the originals of the resolution. The resolution shall specify in detail:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the exact language of the matter or matters proposed to be considered;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the specific limitation or limitations to be suspended;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the specific action contemplated by the conference committee;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) except for a resolution suspending the limitations on the conferees for the general appropriations bill, the reasons that suspension of the limitations is being requested; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a fiscal note distributed with the resolution outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the items to be included in the conference committee report that would otherwise be prohibited but for the passage of the resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) In the application of Subsection (g) of this section to appropriations bills, the resolution:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) need not include changes in amounts resulting from a proposed salary plan or changes in format that do not affect the amount of an appropriation or the method of finance of an appropriation, but shall include a general statement describing the salary plan or format change;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) need not include differences in language which do not affect the substance of the bill;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) if suspending a limitation imposed by Subsection (b)(2), (3), (4), or (5) of this section, must specify the amount by which the appropriation in the conference committee report is less than or greater than the amount permitted for that item of appropriation under Subsection (b) of this section; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) shall be available in its entirety on the electronic legislative information system that is accessible by the general public.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Permission granted by a resolution under Subsection (f) of this section shall suspend the limitations only for the matter or matters clearly specified in the resolution, and the action of the conference committee shall be in conformity with the resolution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 10. PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS. (a) A conference committee report on the general appropriations bill must be printed and a copy furnished to each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 48 hours before action can be taken on the report by the house during a regular session or at least 24 hours before action can be taken by the house during a special session. All other conference committee reports must be printed and a copy furnished to each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 24 hours before action can be taken on the report by the house during a regular or special session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Three original copies of a conference committee report shall be submitted to the chief clerk for printing. Each original conference committee report shall contain the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the signatures of the house conferees and senate conferees who voted to adopt the conference committee report;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the text of the bill or resolution as adopted by the conference committee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) an analysis of the conference committee report as required by Section 11 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Before action can be taken by the house on a conference committee report on a bill or joint resolution, other than the general appropriations bill, a fiscal note outlining the fiscal implications and probable cost of the conference committee report shall be submitted to the chief clerk, and a copy of the fiscal note shall be distributed with the conference committee report on its printing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Before a vote on the floor can be taken by the house on a conference committee report on a bill or joint resolution for which a tax equity note was required under Rule 4, Section 34(b)(5), a tax equity note estimating the general effects of the conference committee report on the distribution of tax and fee burdens among individuals and businesses shall be submitted to the chief clerk, and a copy of the tax equity note shall be made available to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 11. ANALYSIS OF REPORTS. (a) All reports of conference committees shall include an analysis showing wherein the report differs from the house and senate versions of the bill, resolution, or other matter in disagreement. The analysis of appropriations bills shall show in dollar amounts the differences between the conference committee report and the house and senate versions. No conference committee report shall be considered by the house unless such an analysis has been prepared and distributed to each member.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The analysis shall to the extent practical indicate any instance wherein the conference committee in its report appears to have exceeded the limitations imposed on its jurisdiction by Section 9 of this rule. An analysis and the conference committee report in which the analysis is included are not subject to a point of order due to a failure to comply with this subsection or due to a mistake made in complying with this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 12. CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS. A conference committee report is not subject to amendment, but must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. While a conference committee report is pending, a motion to deal with individual amendments in disagreement is not in order.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 13. WHEN REPORTS NOT ACCEPTABLE. When a conference committee report is not acceptable to the house for any reason, it may be recommitted to the same committee with the request for further consideration, and the house may or may not give any specific instructions on the report to the conference committee; or the house may request the appointment by the senate of a new conference committee and then proceed to empower the speaker to name new conferees for the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 14. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. WHEN RULES ARE SILENT. If the rules are silent or inexplicit on any question of order or parliamentary practice, the Rules of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, and its practice as reflected in published precedents, and Mason&#39;s Manual of Legislative Procedure shall be considered as authority.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES. (a) Amendments to the rules of the house shall be proposed by house resolutions which shall be referred at once, without debate, to the Committee on House Administration for study and recommendation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A resolution proposing an amendment to the rules shall not be considered by the house until a printed copy of the resolution has been provided to each member of the house at least 48 hours before consideration.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Amendments to the rules shall require a majority vote of the house for adoption.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES. A motion to suspend the rules shall be in order at any time, except when motions to adjourn or recess are pending, even when the house is operating under the previous question. A motion to &quot;suspend all rules&quot; shall be sufficient to suspend every rule under which the house is operating for a particular purpose except the provisions of the constitution and the joint rules of the two houses. If the rules have been suspended on a main motion for a given purpose, no other motion to suspend the rules on a main motion shall be in order until the original purpose has been accomplished.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 4. NOTICE OF PENDING MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES. It shall not be in order to move to suspend the rules or the regular order of business to take up a measure out of its regular order, and the speaker shall not recognize anyone for either purpose, unless the speaker has announced to the house in session that the speaker would recognize a member for that purpose at least one hour before the member is so recognized to make the motion. In making the announcement to the house, the speaker shall advise the house of the member&#39;s name and the bill number, and this information, together with the time that the announcement was made, shall be entered in the journal. This rule may be suspended only by unanimous consent.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 5. VOTE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSPENSION. A standing rule of the house may be suspended by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present. However, if a rule contains a specific provision showing the vote by which that rule may be suspended, that vote shall be required for the suspension of the rule. The specific provision may not be suspended under the provisions of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 6. DISPOSAL OF MEASURES TAKEN UP UNDER SUSPENSION. Any measure taken up under suspension and not disposed of on the same day shall go over as pending or unfinished business to the next day that the house is in session, and shall be considered thereafter from day to day (except the days used for the consideration of senate bills) until disposed of.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 15. APPROPRIATE WORKPLACE CONDUCT</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. STATEMENT OF POLICY. (a) The house finds that:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a safe and professional environment in which each individual is treated with respect is essential for conducting the legislative business of Texas;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) harassment based on an individual&#39;s characteristics and activity protected by law is inconsistent with the necessary safe and professional environment; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) there is a need for policies designed to prevent harassment and to appropriately address it if it occurs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The house declares that all forms of harassment prohibited by law (including harassment by the making of a complaint of harassment or discrimination or by participating in the investigation of a complaint) are against the policy of the house.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Members, officers, and employees of the house are expected to promote public confidence in the integrity of the house by:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) conducting themselves in a manner that is free of harassment in each setting related to the service of the member, officer, or employee; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) reporting any harassment in the workplace of which they have direct, personal knowledge.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) This rule is the policy on which the house relies for guidance in promoting appropriate workplace conduct. This rule is not intended to, and does not, create an independent cause of action, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the house or its officers, employees, or agents;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the State of Texas or its departments, agencies, entities, officers, employees, or agents; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) any other person.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">RULE 16. SPECIAL RULE</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">CHAPTER A. GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 1. PURPOSE; SCOPE; APPLICATION. (a) This rule is adopted to ensure that the house is able to carry out its legislative responsibilities under the Texas Constitution in the event of disruptions caused by actual or imminent threat of an emergency, including an epidemic or a pandemic.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A section of this rule governs the procedure of the house and its committees only when the section is activated as provided by this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) During the time a section of this rule is activated, the provisions of that section prevail over a provision of Rules 1 through 15 to the extent of any conflict between the provisions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) This chapter is not subject to deactivation under Section 4 of this rule.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 2. ACTIVATION AND REACTIVATION. (a) A section of this rule may be activated only as provided by this section. A section of this rule that has been deactivated under this chapter may be reactivated only as provided by this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Activation or reactivation of a section of this rule may occur only if:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a disaster has been declared and is currently in effect in this state as the result of a declaration by:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) the president of the United States under the Robert T.

LIMITATIONS ON JURISDICTION. (a) Conference committees shall limit\ntheir discussions and their actions solely to the matters in disagreement\nbetween the two houses. A conference committee shall have no authority with\nrespect to any bill or resolution:\n\n(1) to change, alter, or amend text which is not in disagreement;\n\n(2) to omit text which is not in disagreement;\n\n(3) to add text on any matter which is not in disagreement;\n\n(4) to add text on any matter which is not included in either the house or\nsenate version of the bill or resolution.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(b) Conference committees on appropriations bills, like other conference\ncommittees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the\nmatters in disagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations\ncontained elsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on appropriations\nbills shall be strictly limited in its authority as follows:\n\n(1) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill, the item must be included in the conference committee report.\n\n(2) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill, and in identical amounts, no change can be made in the item or the\namount.\n\n(3) If an item of appropriation appears in both house and senate versions of\nthe bill but in different amounts, no change can be made in the item, but the\namount shall be at the discretion of the conference committee, provided that\nthe amount shall not exceed the larger version and shall not be less than the\nsmaller version.\n\n(4) If an item of appropriation appears in one version of the bill and not in\nthe other, the item can be included or omitted at the discretion of the\nconference committee. If the item is included, the amount shall not exceed the\nsum specified in the version containing the item.\n\n(5) If an item of appropriation appears in neither the house nor the senate\nversion of the bill, the item must not be included in the conference committee\nreport. However, the conference committee report may include appropriations\nfor purposes or programs authorized by bills that have been passed and sent to\nthe governor and may include contingent appropriations for purposes or\nprograms authorized by bills that have been passed by at least one house.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(c) Conference committees on tax bills, like other conference committees,\nshall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the matters in\ndisagreement between the two houses. In addition to the limitations contained\nelsewhere in the rules, a conference committee on a tax bill shall be strictly\nlimited in its authority as follows:\n\n(1) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, the\nitem must be included in the conference committee report.\n\n(2) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill, and\nin identical form and with identical rates, no change can be made in the item\nor the rate provided.\n\n(3) If a tax item appears in both house and senate versions of the bill but at\ndiffering rates, no change can be made in the item, but the rate shall be at\nthe discretion of the conference committee, provided that the rate shall not\nexceed the higher version and shall not be less than the lower version.\n\n(4) If a tax item appears in one version of the bill and not in the other, the\nitem can be included or omitted at the discretion of the conference committee.\nIf the item is included, the rate shall not exceed the rate specified in the\nversion containing the item.\n\n(5) If a tax item appears in neither the house nor the senate version of the\nbill, the item must not be included in the conference committee report.\n\nThis rule shall be strictly construed by the presiding officer in each house\nto achieve these purposes.\n\n(d) Conference committees on reapportionment bills, to the extent possible,\nshall limit their discussions and their actions to the matters in disagreement\nbetween the two houses. Since the adjustment of one district in a\nreapportionment bill will inevitably affect other districts, the strict rule\nof construction imposed on other conference committees must be relaxed\nsomewhat when reapportionment bills are involved. Accordingly, the following\nauthority and limitations shall apply only to conference committees on\nreapportionment bills:\n\n(1) If the matters in disagreement affect only certain districts, and other\ndistricts are identical in both house and senate versions of the bill, the\nconference committee shall make adjustments only in those districts whose\nrearrangement is essential to the effective resolving of the matters in\ndisagreement. All other districts shall remain unchanged.\n\n(2) If the matters in disagreement permeate the entire bill and affect most,\nif not all, of the districts, the conference committee shall have wide\ndiscretion in rearranging the districts to the extent necessary to resolve all\ndifferences between the two houses.\n\n(3) Insofar as the actual structure of the districts is concerned, and only to\nthat extent, the provisions of Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply\nto conference committees on reapportionment bills.\n\n(e) Conference committees on recodification bills, like other conference\ncommittees, shall limit their discussions and their actions solely to the\nmatters in disagreement between the two houses. The comprehensive and\ncomplicated nature of recodification bills makes necessary the relaxing of the\nstrict rule of construction imposed on other conference committees only to the\nfollowing extent:\n\n(1) If it develops in conference committee that material has been\ninadvertently included in both house and senate versions which properly has no\nplace in the recodification, that material may be omitted from the conference\ncommittee report, if by that omission the existing statute is not repealed,\naltered, or amended.\n\n(2) If it develops in conference committee that material has been\ninadvertently omitted from both the house and senate versions which properly\nshould be included if the recodification is to achieve its purpose of being\nall-inclusive of the statutes being recodified, that material may be added to\nthe conference committee report, if by the addition the existing statute is\nmerely restated without substantive change in existing law.\n\n(f) Limitations imposed on certain conference committees by the provisions of\nthis section may be suspended in part by permission of the house to allow\nconsideration of and action on a specific matter or matters which otherwise\nwould be prohibited. Permission shall be granted only by resolution passed by\nmajority vote of the house. All such resolutions shall be privileged in nature\nand need not be referred to a committee. The introduction of such a resolution\nshall be announced from the house floor and the resolution shall be eligible\nfor consideration by the house:\n\n(1) three hours after a copy of the resolution has been distributed to each\nmember; or\n\n(2) for a resolution suspending limitations on a conference committee\nconsidering the general appropriations bill, 48 hours in a regular session and\n24 hours in a special session after a copy of the resolution has been\ndistributed to each member.\n\n(g) The time at which the copies of such a resolution are distributed to the\nmembers shall be time-stamped on the originals of the resolution. The\nresolution shall specify in detail:\n\n(1) the exact language of the matter or matters proposed to be considered;\n\n(2) the specific limitation or limitations to be suspended;\n\n(3) the specific action contemplated by the conference committee;\n\n(4) except for a resolution suspending the limitations on the conferees for\nthe general appropriations bill, the reasons that suspension of the\nlimitations is being requested; and\n\n(5) a fiscal note distributed with the resolution outlining the fiscal\nimplications and probable cost of the items to be included in the conference\ncommittee report that would otherwise be prohibited but for the passage of the\nresolution.\n\n(h) In the application of Subsection (g) of this section to appropriations\nbills, the resolution:\n\n(1) need not include changes in amounts resulting from a proposed salary plan\nor changes in format that do not affect the amount of an appropriation or the\nmethod of finance of an appropriation, but shall include a general statement\ndescribing the salary plan or format change;\n\n(2) need not include differences in language which do not affect the substance\nof the bill;\n\n(3) if suspending a limitation imposed by Subsection (b)(2), (3), (4), or (5)\nof this section, must specify the amount by which the appropriation in the\nconference committee report is less than or greater than the amount permitted\nfor that item of appropriation under Subsection (b) of this section; and\n\n(4) shall be available in its entirety on the electronic legislative\ninformation system that is accessible by the general public.\n\n(i) Permission granted by a resolution under Subsection (f) of this section\nshall suspend the limitations only for the matter or matters clearly specified\nin the resolution, and the action of the conference committee shall be in\nconformity with the resolution.\n\nSec. 10. PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF REPORTS. (a) A conference committee\nreport on the general appropriations bill must be printed and a copy furnished\nto each member as provided by Rule 12, Section 1, at least 48 hours before\naction can be taken on the report by the house during a regular session or at\nleast 24 hours before action can be taken by the house during a special\nsession.

The\nanalysis of appropriations bills shall show in dollar amounts the differences\nbetween the conference committee report and the house and senate versions. No\nconference committee report shall be considered by the house unless such an\nanalysis has been prepared and distributed to each member.\n\n(b) The analysis shall to the extent practical indicate any instance wherein\nthe conference committee in its report appears to have exceeded the\nlimitations imposed on its jurisdiction by Section 9 of this rule. An analysis\nand the conference committee report in which the analysis is included are not\nsubject to a point of order due to a failure to comply with this subsection or\ndue to a mistake made in complying with this subsection.\n\nSec. 12. CONSIDERATION OF REPORTS. A conference committee report is not\nsubject to amendment, but must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. While\na conference committee report is pending, a motion to deal with individual\namendments in disagreement is not in order.\n\nSec. 13. WHEN REPORTS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
