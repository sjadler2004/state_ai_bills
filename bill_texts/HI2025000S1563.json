The legislature finds that policyholders often lack sufficient\ninformation about how insurance rates are determined. This lack of\ntransparency undermines consumer confidence and fosters distrust in the\ninsurance industry. Drawing inspiration from states that have implemented\nrobust insurance rate regulation and transparency measures that have\nsuccessfully balanced consumer protection with market stability, the\nlegislature finds that these measures aim to empower consumers through\nenhanced access to information, strengthen advocacy for fair treatment, and\nprotect against arbitrary or unfair rate-setting practices. By fostering a\nmore transparent and equitable insurance market, these provisions seek to\npromote greater trust and accountability within the industry.\n\nAccordingly, the purpose of this Act is to:\n\n(1) Establish rate transparency requirements for insurance companies operating\nin the State; and\n\n(2) Establish an office of insurance consumer affairs within the insurance\ndivision of the department of commerce and consumer affairs to provide\noversight, information, and consumer advocacy.\n\nSECTION 2.
