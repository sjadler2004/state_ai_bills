This goal cannot be met without ensuring the availability of community residential opportunities in the residential areas of this state. The Legislature, therefore, declares that all persons with developmental disabilities who live in licensed community homes shall have a family living environment comparable to other Floridians and that such residences shall be considered and treated as a functional equivalent of a family unit and not as an institution, business, or boarding home.

The mission of the agency is to support\nindividuals with disabilities and their families in living, learning, and\nworking within their communities by creating multiple pathways to\npossibilities for such individuals and their families_ ~~existing state\nprograms for the treatment of individuals with developmental disabilities,\nwhich often unnecessarily place clients in institutions, are unreasonably\ncostly, are ineffective in bringing the individual client to his or her\nmaximum potential, and are in fact debilitating to many clients. A redirection\nin state treatment programs for individuals with developmental disabilities is\nnecessary if any significant amelioration of the problems faced by such\nindividuals is ever to take place. Such redirection should place primary\nemphasis on programs that prevent or reduce the severity of developmental\ndisabilities~~. ~~Further,~~ The greatest priority shall be given to the\ndevelopment and implementation of community-based services that will enable\nindividuals with developmental disabilities to achieve their greatest\npotential for independent and productive living, enable them to live in their\nown homes or in residences located in their own communities, and permit them\nto be diverted or removed from unnecessary institutional placements. This goal\ncannot be met without ensuring the availability of community residential\nopportunities in the residential areas of this state. The Legislature,\ntherefore, declares that all persons with developmental disabilities who live\nin licensed community homes shall have a family living environment comparable\nto other Floridians and that such residences shall be considered and treated\nas a functional equivalent of a family unit and not as an institution,\nbusiness, or boarding home. The Legislature further declares that, in\ndeveloping community-based programs and services for individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities, private businesses, not-for-profit corporations,\nunits of local government, and other organizations capable of providing needed\nservices to clients in a cost-efficient manner shall be given preference in\nlieu of operation of programs directly by state agencies. ~~Finally, it is the\nintent of the Legislature that all caretakers unrelated to individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities receiving care shall be of good moral character.~~\n\n**Section 8.
