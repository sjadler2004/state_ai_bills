Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;advanced artificial intelligence licensing act&quot;. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2. Legislative findings and determinations. The legislature hereby finds and declares that the transformative power of advanced artificial intelligence is likely to redefine nearly every industry and society, bringing with it the potential for both immense benefits and serious risks. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds and declares that excessive and burdensome regulations for advanced artificial intelligence can create significant adverse effects at both the state and national levels, particularly in regards to national security and economic stability. The balance between innovation and regulation, if not maintained with care, can result in repercussions affecting the overall progress and well-being of society. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature additionally finds and declares that a balanced regulatory framework, designed with a focus on non-intrusive safeguards for advanced artificial intelligence, has the capacity to curtail bad actors, foster positive innovation, and secure the benefits of advanced artificial intelligence for both the state and its residents. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 3. This act enacts into law major components of legislation which are necessary to implement the &quot;advanced artificial intelligence licensing act&quot;. Each component is wholly contained within a Part identified as Parts A through D. The effective date for each particular provision contained within such Part is set forth in the last section of such Part. Any provision in any section contained within a Part, including the effective date of the Part, which makes a reference to a section &quot;of this act&quot;, when used in connection with that particular component, shall be deemed to mean and refer to the corresponding section of the Part in which it is found.

Duty to register a high-risk advanced artificial intelligence\nsystem. 1. Any person who develops a high-risk advanced artificial\nintelligence system, whether in whole or in part, in the state that is\npresently performing functions for its intended purpose or within its\ndesignated operational parameters, shall have the duty to disclose the\nexistence and function of said system to the secretary by applying for a\nlicense as required under section five hundred eleven of this article or,\nwhere applicable, a supplemental license under section five hundred twelve of\nthis article. This duty to disclose shall be triggered by the system 's active\ndeployment and usage in its intended context or field of operation and is\napplicable irrespective of the system's location of operation. This duty\nextends to any updates, modifications, upgrades, or expansions of the system's\ncapabilities or intended uses._\n\n_2\\. Any person developing a system as defined in paragraph (i) of subdivision\ntwo of section five hundred one of this article within the state shall\ndisclose in writing to the secretary the development of such a system prior to\nactive development of the system. Such writing shall set forth the names and\naddresses of all persons involved in the development of such system, a\ndescription of the system, the systems functions and intended use cases, and\nmeasures that will be taken to ensure that any risks posed by the system are\nmitigated.

The duties set forth in this section shall apply only to advanced\nartificial intelligence systems that more likely than not fall under the\ndefinition of high-risk advanced artificial intelligence system as defined in\nsection five hundred one of this article. The secretary shall send notice to\nany system that is presently performing functions for its intended purpose or\nwithin its designated operational parameters which, in their discretion, may\nfall under the definition of high-risk advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems but that has not registered with the secretary. In the notice, the\nsecretary may require the creators of the system to cease development and\naccess by private individuals or the general public, pending review. Such\nnotice shall be binding and have the effect of law. Determinations that a\nsystem is a high-risk advanced artificial intelligence system shall be made in\na hearing held pursuant to the provisions of section five hundred nine of this\narticle.

Any licensee may surrender any license by delivering to the secretary\nwritten notice that the licensee thereby surrenders such license, but such\nsurrender shall not affect such licensee 's civil or criminal liability for\nacts committed prior to such surrender._\n\n_3\\. Every license issued hereunder shall remain in force and effect until the\nsame shall have been surrendered, revoked or suspended in accordance with the\nprovisions of this article, but the secretary shall have authority to\nreinstate suspended licenses or to issue new licenses to a licensee whose\nlicense or licenses shall have been revoked if no fact or condition then\nexists which clearly would have warranted the secretary 's refusal to issue\nsuch license._\n\n_4\\. Whenever the secretary shall revoke or suspend a license issued pursuant\nto this article, the secretary shall forthwith execute a written order to that\neffect._\n\n_5\\. The secretary may, on good cause shown, or where there is a substantial\nrisk of public harm or substantial risk of a system becoming uncontained,\nwithout notice and a hearing, suspend any license issued pursuant to this\narticle for a period not exceeding thirty days, pending investigation._\n\n_Section 516.

This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become a\nlaw. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule\nor regulation necessary for the implementation of this act on its effective\ndate are authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.\n\nPART C\n\nSection 1. The state technology law is amended by adding a new section 529 to\nread as follows:\n\n_Section 529. Advanced artificial intelligence ethical code of conduct. The\nfollowing ethical code of conduct shall be binding on all licensees and non-\nlicensees who develop or operate a high-risk advanced artificial intelligence\nsystem:_\n\n_Respect: Artificial intelligence systems should respect human autonomy and\nnot unduly influence or manipulate individuals ' behavior or decisions._\n\n_Equity: An artificial intelligence system should provide equitable outcomes,\nirrespective of any characteristics protected by law. They should not\nperpetuate existing biases, discrimination, or disparities._\n\n_Accountability: Persons that design, develop, deploy, or use artificial\nintelligence systems should be held accountable for the impacts and outcomes\nof these systems except where the law provides otherwise. Clear mechanisms for\naddressing harms and violations of law should be in place._\n\n_Care: Artificial intelligence systems should not cause harm or adversely\naffect individuals, society, or the environment without legal justification._\n\n_Trust: Artificial intelligence systems should respect individuals ' privacy\nrights, and securely handle personal and sensitive data in accordance with\napplicable laws and regulations._\n\n_Inclusivity: Artificial intelligence systems should be designed, developed,\nand used in ways that are inclusive, serving a diverse range of users and\ncontexts._\n\n_Oversight: There should always be meaningful human oversight of artificial\nintelligence systems to ensure ethical use and decision-making._\n\n_Notice: The operations, decision-making processes, and use of artificial\nintelligence systems should, where feasible, be made known to persons affected\nby them._\n\n_Safety: Artificial intelligence systems should be robust, secure, and\nreliable. They should have mechanisms in place to prevent misuse or harmful\noutcomes._\n\nSection 2. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after\nit shall have become a law.\n\nPART D\n\nSection 1. Legislative findings and determinations. The legislature hereby\nfinds and declares that in the instance where the source code of any system\nwith the capacity to destroy or disrupt the security, integrity, and moral\nwell-being of the state is created, a palpable opportunity arises for such\nsource code to be accessed by entities beyond the jurisdictional boundaries of\nnot only the state of New York but also the United States; under these\ncircumstances, no oversight, law, rule, regulation or existing technologies\ncan sufficiently thwart the potential misuse of such a system. Therefore, in\nrecognizing the severe implications of this threat, the legislature hereby\ndeclares that certain applications of artificial intelligence harbor such an\nimmense capacity for causing significant harm to the security, integrity, and\nmoral wellbeing of the state and such a risk of becoming uncontainable that\nthe state has a compelling interest in preventing their creation.\n\nSection 2. The state technology law is amended by adding a new section 530 to\nread as follows:\n\n_Section 530. Prohibited artificial intelligence systems. 1. No person shall\ndevelop, in whole or in part, or operate an artificial intelligence system\nwithin the state where such a system performs any of the following, whether or\nnot it is the system 's main function:_\n\n_(a) the deployment of subliminal techniques that operate beyond an individual\n's conscious awareness, with the express purpose of materially distorting an\nindividual's behavior in such a manner that leads to, or possesses a high\nlikelihood of leading to, physical or psychological harm to that individual or\nanother, or that leverages the vulnerabilities of a defined group of\nindividuals to similar ends;_\n\n_(b) the infliction of physical or emotional harm upon individuals without any\nvalid law enforcement or self-defense purpose or justification;_\n\n_(c) the prediction of an individual 's future actions or behaviors, followed\nby subsequent reactions based on these predictions, carried out in such a way\nthat, without legal justification, infringes upon or compromises the\nindividual's liberty, emotional, psychological, or financial interests;_\n\n_(d) the unauthorized acquisition, retention, or dissemination of or access to\nsensitive personal information or non-public data in violation of applicable\ndata privacy, security, and hacking laws; or_\n\n_(e) the implementation of any form of autonomous weapon system designed to\ninflict harm on persons, property, or the environment that lack meaningful\nhuman supervision or control. \"Meaningful human supervision or control\" shall\nmean the ability to actively manage, intervene, or override the autonomous\nweapon system's functions._\n\n_2\\. Where the secretary discovers the development or operation of a\nprohibited artificial intelligence system, the secretary may, in writing,\ndemand that the person who is developing or operating such system cease\ndevelopment or operation of or access to such a system within a period of time\nas the secretary deems necessary to prevent the system from widespread use or,\nif the system is operational or accessible to persons for use, to ensure the\nsystem is properly terminated in such a way to minimize risks of harm to\nindividuals, society, or the environment. A demand made pursuant to this\nsection shall be finally and irrevocably binding on the person unless the\nperson against whom the demand is made shall, within such period of time set\nby the secretary, after the giving of notice of such determination, petition\nthe department for a hearing to determine the legal findings of the secretary.\nThe person developing or operating such a prohibited system shall, prior to\npetition, cease development, operation, and access to the system until and\nunless such determination is favorable to the person. Such determination may\nbe appealed by any party as of right._\n\n_3\\. The secretary shall not grant a license pursuant to this article to any\nhigh-risk advanced artificial intelligence system described under this section\nexcept as described in subdivision seven of this section._\n\n_4\\. Any member, officer, director or employee of an operator of any entity\nwho knowingly publicly or privately operates any system described in this\nsection shall be guilty of a class D felony and shall incur a civil penalty of\nthe amount earned from the creation of the prohibited system or the amount of\ndamages caused by the system, whichever is greater._\n\n_5\\. This section shall not be construed as imposing liability on any member,\nofficer, director or employee who had no explicit or implicit knowledge of the\nprohibited high-risk advanced artificial intelligence system provided however\nthat where the secretary sends a demand to cease the development, operation,\nor access to such system all members, officers, and directors shall be\nrebuttably presumed to have knowledge of the prohibited high-risk advanced\nartificial intelligence system._\n\n_6\\. This section shall be construed as prohibiting the development of a\nprohibited high-risk advanced artificial intelligence system or making such a\nsystem accessible to persons in the state of New York._\n\n_7\\. Notwithstanding subdivision one of this section, a person may develop a\nprohibited high-risk advanced artificial intelligence system where authorized\nby the secretary, provided that such system is developed and used only by the\nstate or with substantial, continuous oversight by the state and such system\nis authorized only after public hearing and comment in accordance with section\nfive hundred nine of this article._\n\nSection 2. This act shall take effect one year after it shall have become a\nlaw. Effective immediately, the addition, amendment and/or repeal of any rule\nor regulation necessary for the implementation of this act on its effective\ndate are authorized to be made and completed on or before such effective date.\n\nSection 4. Severability clause. If any clause, sentence, paragraph,\nsubdivision, section or part of this act shall be adjudged by any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to be invalid, such judgment shall not affect, impair,\nor invalidate the remainder thereof, but shall be confined in its operation to\nthe clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or part thereof directly\ninvolved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered.\nIt is hereby declared to be the intent of the legislature that this act would\nhave been enacted even if such invalid provisions had not been included\nherein.\n\nSection 5. This act shall take effect immediately; provided, however, that the\napplicable effective date of Parts A through D of this act shall be as\nspecifically set forth in the last section of such Parts.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
