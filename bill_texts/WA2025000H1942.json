The task force findings and recommendations must\ninclude:\n\n(a) A literature review of public policy issues with artificial intelligence,\nincluding benefits and risks to the public broadly, historically excluded\ncommunities, and other identifiable groups, racial equity considerations,\nworkforce impacts, and ethical concerns;\n\n(b) A review of existing protections under state and federal law for\nindividual data and privacy rights, safety, civil rights, and intellectual\nproperty rights, and how federal, state, and local laws relating to artificial\nintelligence align, differ, conflict, and interact across levels of\ngovernment;\n\n(c) A recommended set of guiding principles for artificial intelligence use\ninformed by standards established by relevant bodies, including recommending a\ndefinition for ethical artificial intelligence and guiding principles;\n\n(d) Identification of high-risk uses of artificial intelligence, including\nthose that may negatively affect safety or fundamental rights;\n\n(e) Opportunities to support and promote the innovation of artificial\nintelligence technologies through grants and incentives;\n\n(f) Recommendations on appropriate uses of and limitations on the use of\nartificial intelligence by state and local governments and the private sector;\n\n(g) Recommendations relating to the appropriate and legal use of training\ndata;\n\n(h) Algorithmic discrimination issues which may occur when artificial\nintelligence systems are used and contribute to unjustified differential\ntreatment or impacts disfavoring people on the basis of race, color, national\norigin, citizen or immigration status, families with children, creed,\nreligious belief or affiliation, sex, marital status, the presence of any\nsensory, mental, or physical disability, age, honorably discharged veteran or\nmilitary status, sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity, or\nany other protected class under RCW _49.60.010_ and recommendations to\nmitigate and protect against algorithmic discrimination;\n\n(i) Recommendations on minimizing unlawful discriminatory or biased outputs or\napplications;\n\n(j) Recommendations on prioritizing transparency so that the behavior and\nfunctional components artificial intelligence can be understood in order to\nenable the identification of performance issues, safety and privacy concerns,\nbiases, exclusionary practices, and unintended outcomes;\n\n(k) Racial equity issues posed by artificial intelligence systems and ways to\nmitigate the concerns to build equity into the systems;\n\n(l) Civil liberties issues posed by artificial intelligence systems and civil\nrights and civil liberties protections to be incorporated into artificial\nintelligence systems;\n\n(m) Recommendations as to how the state should educate the public on the\ndevelopment and use of artificial intelligence, including information about\ndata privacy and security, data collection and retention practices, use of\nindividual data in machine learning, and intellectual property considerations\nregarding generative artificial intelligence;\n\n(n) A review of protections of personhood, including replicas of voice or\nlikeness, in typical contract structures, and a review of artificial\nintelligence tools used to support employment decisions;\n\n(o) Proposed state guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence to inform\nthe development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence systems to:\n\n(i) Retain appropriate human agency and oversight;\n\n(ii) Be subject to internal and external security testing of systems before\npublic release for high-risk artificial intelligence systems;\n\n(iii) Protect data privacy and security;\n\n(iv) Promote appropriate transparency for consumers when they interact with\nartificial intelligence systems or products created by artificial\nintelligence; and\n\n(v) Ensure accountability, considering oversight, impact assessment,\nauditability, and due diligence mechanisms;\n\n(p) A review of existing civil and criminal remedies for addressing potential\nharms resulting from the use of artificial intelligence systems and\nrecommendations, if needed, for new means of enforcement and remedies; and\n\n(q) Recommendations for establishing an ongoing committee that must study\nemerging technologies not limited to artificial technology.\n\n(5) The executive committee of the task force must hold its first meeting\nwithin 45 days of final appointments to the task force and must meet at least\ntwice each year thereafter. The task force must submit reports to the governor\nand the appropriate committees of the legislature detailing its findings and\nrecommendations. A preliminary report must be delivered by December 31, 2024,\nan interim report by December 1, 2025, and a final report by July 1, 2026.\nMeeting summaries must be posted to the website of the attorney general's\noffice within 30 days of any meeting by the task force.\n\n(6) Legislative members of the task force shall be reimbursed for travel\nexpenses in accordance with RCW _44.04.120_. Nonlegislative members are not\nentitled to be reimbursed for travel expenses if they are elected officials or\nare participating on behalf of an employer, governmental entity, or other\norganization. Any reimbursement for other nonlegislative members is subject to\nchapter _43.03_ RCW.\n\n(7) To ensure that the task force has diverse and inclusive representation of\nthose affected by its work, task force members, including subcommittee\nmembers, whose participation in the task force may be hampered by financial\nhardship and may be compensated as provided in RCW _43.03.220_.\n\n(8) The definitions in this subsection apply throughout this section unless\nthe context clearly requires otherwise.\n\n(a) \"Artificial intelligence\" means the use of machine learning and related\ntechnologies that use data to train statistical models for the purpose of\nenabling computer systems to perform tasks normally associated with human\nintelligence or perception, such as computer vision, speech or natural\nlanguage processing, and content generation.\n\n(b) \"Generative artificial intelligence\" means an artificial intelligence\nsystem that generates novel data or content based on a foundation model.\n\n(c) \"Machine learning\" means the process by which artificial intelligence is\ndeveloped using data and algorithms to draw inferences therefrom to\nautomatically adapt or improve its accuracy without explicit programming.\n\n(d) \"Training data\" means labeled data that is used to teach artificial\nintelligence models or machine learning algorithms to make proper decisions.\nTraining data may include, but is not limited to, annotated text, images,\nvideo, or audio.\n\n(9) This section expires June 30, 2027.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
