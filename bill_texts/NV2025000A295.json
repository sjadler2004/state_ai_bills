(BDR 57-238)\n\nFISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.\n\nEffect on the State: Yes.\n\nAN ACT relating to insurance; imposing requirements relating to prior\nauthorization; prescribing certain requirements relating to the use of\nartificial intelligence by health insurers; requiring the compilation and\npublication of certain reports relating to prior authorization; providing for\nthe investigation and adjudication of certain violations; providing for the\nimposition of civil and administrative penalties for such violations; and\nproviding other matters properly relating thereto.\n\n**Legislative Counsel 's Digest:**\n\nExisting law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization\nbefore an insured may receive coverage for health and dental care in certain\ncircumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law\nrequires the insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization within 20\ndays of the receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) **Sections 9 and 17** of\nthis bill require an insurer, including Medicaid and the Children's Health\nInsurance Program, to approve or make an adverse determination on a request\nfor prior authorization, or request additional, medically relevant information\nwithin: (1) five days after receiving the request, for medical or dental care\nthat is not urgent; or (2) forty-eight hours after receiving the request, for\ncare that is urgent. **Sections 9 and 17** require an insurer to transmit\ncertain information to an insured and his or her provider of health care after\nmaking an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization\npertaining to the insured. **Sections 9 and 17** also provide that a request\nfor prior authorization that has been approved by the insurer for a continuous\ncourse of treatment relating to a chronic or long-term condition remains valid\nfor 12 months, with certain exceptions.\n\n**Sections 6 and 18** of this bill require an insurer that employs or utilizes\nan artificial intelligence system or automated decision tool and, if such a\nsystem or tool is used under Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance\nProgram, the Department of Health and Human Services to process requests for\nprior authorization to transmit a notice to each of its insureds that: (1)\ndiscloses the insurer's use of the system or tool to process requests for\nprior authorization; and (2) describes certain aspects of the system or tool.\n**Section 6 and 18** prohibit an insurer from using an artificial intelligence\nsystem or automated decision tool to make an adverse determination on a\nrequest for prior authorization, or to terminate, reduce or modify a\npreviously approved request for prior authorization, unless that action is\nindependently reviewed by a physician or dentist, as applicable, who possesses\ncertain qualifications.\n\n**Section 7** of this bill requires certain insurers to annually compile and\nsubmit a report to the Commissioner of Insurance and the Director of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services that contains certain information\nrelating to the requests for prior authorization for care provided to insureds\nin this State during the immediately preceding year. **Section 7** requires\nthe Director and the Commissioner to publish the reports submitted by insurers\nto on their respective Internet websites. **Section 19** of this bill requires\nthe Department to annually compile and publish a similar report containing\ninformation relating to requests for prior authorization for care provided to\nrecipients of Medicaid during the immediately preceding calendar year.\n\n**Section 8** of this bill prescribes procedures for investigating and\nimposing penalties against a private sector insurer that: (1) fails to submit\na report required by **section 7** ; or (2) fails to comply with the\nrequirements for making determinations on requests for prior authorization\nduring the periods of time established by **section 9**. **Section 8** also\nprescribes the amount of the civil penalty that the Commissioner must impose\nfor such violations and authorizes the Commissioner to adopt regulations\nprescribing additional sanctions for repeated noncompliance.\n\n**Sections 3-5 and 16** of this bill define certain terms, and **section 2**\nof this bill establishes the applicability of the definitions set forth in\n**sections 3-5**. **Section 10** of this bill makes **sections 2-8**\napplicable to nonprofit medical or dental service corporations. **Section 11**\nof this bill makes a conforming change to require the Director of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to administer the provisions of\n**sections 15-19** in the same manner as other provisions governing Medicaid.\n**Sections 12, 13 and 21** of this bill require plans of self-insurance for\nemployees of local governments, the Public Employees' Benefits Program and\nplans of self-insurance for private employers, respectively, to comply with\ncertain requirements of **sections 6 and 9** , to the extent applicable.\n**Section 15** of this bill provides that managed care organizations that\nprovide services to recipients of Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance\nProgram are exempt from **sections 16-19** , which govern prior authorization\nunder Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program provided directly\nby the Department, but such managed care organizations must comply with\n**sections 3-9** , which govern prior authorization required by private sector\nhealth insurers. **Section 20** of this bill requires any policy or procedure\nestablished for prescription drug coverage under Medicaid relating to prior\nauthorization to comply with the provisions of **sections 16-19**.\n\nTHE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEVADA, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEMBLY, DO\nENACT AS FOLLOWS:\n\n**Section 1.** Chapter 687B of NRS is hereby amended by adding thereto the\nprovisions set forth as sections 2 to 8, inclusive, of this act.\n\n**Sec. 2.** _As used in NRS 687B.225 and sections 2 to 8, inclusive, of this\nact, unless the context otherwise requires, the words and terms defined in\nsections 3, 4 and 5 of this act have the meanings ascribed to them in those\nsections._\n\n**Sec. 3.** _\" Adverse determination\" means a determination by a health\ncarrier that an admission, availability of care, continued stay or other\nhealth care service that is a covered benefit has been reviewed and, based on\nthe information provided, does not meet the health carrier's requirements for\nmedical necessity, appropriateness, health care setting, level of care or\neffectiveness, and the requested service or payment for the service is\ntherefore denied, reduced or terminated._\n\n**Sec. 4.** _\" Health carrier\" has the meaning ascribed to it in NRS 695G.024,\nand includes, without limitation, an organization for dental care._\n\n**Sec. 5.** _\" Insured\" means a policyholder, subscriber, enrollee or other\nperson covered by a health carrier._\n\n**Sec. 6.** _1\\.
