In assessing the amount of the penalty, the commissioner shall give\ndue consideration to the size of the employer's business, the good faith basis\nof the employer to believe that its conduct was in compliance with the law,\nthe gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and, in the\ncase of wages, benefits or supplements violations, the failure to comply with\nrecordkeeping or other non-wage requirements.\n\nSection 3. This act shall take effect on the one hundred eightieth day after\nit shall have become a law.
