The filing of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is improper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still require an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and proper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604 (professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606 (professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer, surveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability), and 5608 (action against home inspectors).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2.

Louisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of lack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in a criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not interdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim. Under the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal proceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a civil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person&#39;s limited interdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full interdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less restrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not deprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of limited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article 4551 and Civil Code Article 390.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">* * *</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Art. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception A.

The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph by any written waiver. The requirement provided by this Paragraph shall be expressly waived by a defendant unless the defendant files, in accordance with the provisions of Article 928, a declinatory exception of insufficiency of service of process specifically alleging the failure to timely request service of citation <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or a contradictory motion in accordance with Article 1672(C)</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">* * *</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Art. 1313.

The Article&#39;s use of &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is broad and encompasses the suspected use of &quot;deepfakes&quot;. R.S. 14:73:13 defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean &quot;any audio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered, or digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the individual or replace an individual&#39;s likeness with another individual and depicted in the recording.&quot; Black&#39;s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean a &quot;false video, audio recording, or other medium that is generated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence, with the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory.

The revisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial court to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A of this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be taken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a supervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former Paragraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides for interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C). Paragraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus clearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ from a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C.

Civil Code Article 3462 is hereby amended and reenacted to read as\nfollows:\n\nArt. 3462. Interruption by filing of ~~suit~~ _action_ or by service of\nprocess\n\n~~Prescription~~ _Unless otherwise expressly provided by legislation,\nprescription_ is interrupted when ~~the owner commences action against the\npossessor, or when the obligee commences action against the obligor,~~ _an\naction is commenced_ in a court of competent jurisdiction ~~and venue~~. If\n_an_ action is commenced in ~~an incompetent court, or in an improper venue,~~\n_a court without competent jurisdiction,_ prescription is interrupted only as\nto a defendant served by process within the prescriptive period.\n\nRevision Comments - 2025\n\nThis amendment changes the law. The filing of an action in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is\nimproper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still\nrequire an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and\nproper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604\n(professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606\n(professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer,\nsurveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability),\nand 5608 (action against home inspectors).\n\nSection 2.

For the convenience of the parties and the witnesses and in the interest of\njustice, a court, upon contradictory motion or upon its own motion after\nnotice and hearing, may transfer the custody or support proceeding to another\ncourt where the proceeding ~~might~~ _may_ have been brought.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 371. Attorney\n\n_A._ An attorney ~~at law~~ is an officer of the court. ~~He~~ _An attorney_\nshall ~~conduct himself~~ at all times _act_ with decorum, and in a manner\nconsistent with the dignity and authority of the court and the role ~~which he\nhimself~~ _that the attorney_ should play in the administration of justice.\n\n_B._ ~~He~~ _An attorney_ shall treat _the_ court, its officers, jurors,\nwitnesses, the opposing party, and opposing counsel with due respect; shall\nnot interrupt opposing counsel~~,~~ or otherwise interfere with or impede the\norderly dispatch of judicial business by the court; shall not knowingly\nencourage or produce false evidence _, including evidence that is artificially\ngenerated or altered by any means_ ; and shall not knowingly make any\nmisrepresentation, or otherwise impose upon or deceive the court.\n\n_C. An attorney shall exercise reasonable diligence to verify the authenticity\nof evidence before offering it to the court. If an attorney knew or should\nhave known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that evidence was\nfalse or artificially manipulated, the offering of that evidence without\ndisclosure of that fact shall be considered a violation of this Article._\n\n_D._ For a violation of any of the provisions of this ~~article~~ _Article_ ,\nthe attorney ~~at law subjects himself~~ _is subject_ to punishment for\ncontempt of court~~,~~ and ~~such~~ further disciplinary action as is\notherwise provided by law.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 684. ~~Mental incompetent; interdict~~ _Interdict_\n\nA. ~~A mental incompetent~~ _A person fully interdicted or a person whose\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the procedural capacity to sue_\ndoes not have the procedural capacity to sue.\n\nB. Except as otherwise provided in Articles 4431, 4554, and 4566, the curator\nis the proper plaintiff to sue to enforce a right of ~~an interdict~~ _a\nperson fully interdicted or a person whose limited interdiction specifically\nrestricts the procedural capacity to sue_.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThis amendment seeks to address an issue raised by the court in Walcott v.\nLouisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1\nCir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of\nlack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in\na criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not\ninterdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim.\nUnder the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal\nproceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a\ncivil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person's limited\ninterdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full\ninterdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less\nrestrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not\ndeprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article\n4551 and Civil Code Article 390.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception A. The objections that may\nbe raised through the peremptory exception include but are not limited to the\nfollowing:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No cause of action _, including an objection of no cause of action in\npart, as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or\ntheories against a party, whether in an original demand, reconventional\ndemand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or intervention_.\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nSubparagraph (A)(5) of this Article was amended to clarify that a partial\njudgment sustaining an exception raising the objection of no cause of action\nmay be appropriate when two or more actions based on the same operative facts\nof a single transaction or occurrence are cumulated. This changes the result\nreached by the Louisiana Supreme Court in Everything on Wheels Subaru, Inc. v.\nSubaru South., Inc., 616 So. 2d 1234 (La. 1993).\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 966. Motion for summary judgment; procedure\n\n* * *\n\nB. Unless extended by the court and agreed to by all of the parties, a motion\nfor summary judgment shall be filed, opposed, or replied to in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) ~~Notwithstanding Article 1915(B)(2), the~~ _The_ court shall not\nreconsider or revise the granting of a motion for partial summary judgment on\nmotion of a party who failed to meet the deadlines imposed by this Paragraph,\nnor shall the court consider any documents filed after those deadlines.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1201. Citation; waiver; delay for service\n\n* * *\n\nC. Service of the citation shall be requested on all named defendants within\nninety days of commencement of the action. When a supplemental or amended\npetition is filed naming any additional defendant, service of citation shall\nbe requested within ninety days of its filing, and the additional defendant\nshall be served with the original petition and the supplemental or amended\npetition. The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph\nby any written waiver. The requirement provided by this Paragraph shall be\nexpressly waived by a defendant unless the defendant files, in accordance with\nthe provisions of Article 928, a declinatory exception of insufficiency of\nservice of process specifically alleging the failure to timely request service\nof citation _or a contradictory motion in accordance with Article 1672(C)_.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1313. Service by mail, delivery, or electronic means\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, every pleading subsequent to the\noriginal petition, and every pleading which under an express provision of law\nmay be served as provided in this Article, may be served either by the sheriff\nor by:\n\n* * *\n\n(4) Transmitting a copy by electronic means to counsel of record, or if there\nis no counsel of record, to the adverse party, at the number or addresses\nexpressly designated in a pleading or other writing for receipt of electronic\nservice. Service by electronic means is complete upon transmission but is not\neffective and shall not be certified if the serving party learns _that_ the\ntransmission did not reach the party to be served. _If electronic service\ncannot be effected in accordance with this Subparagraph, service may be\neffected in accordance with other provisions of this Paragraph._\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to Subparagraph (A)(4) of this Article clarifies that if service\ncannot be effected by electronic means, service may be effected in accordance\nwith the other provisions of Paragraph A. See Article 966(B)(1) and (2)\nproviding that a motion for summary judgment, all documents in support of the\nmotion, any opposition to the motion, and all documents in support of the\nopposition shall be filed and served in accordance with Subparagraph (A)(4) of\nthis Article.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1351.

A subpoena shall issue under the seal of the\ncourt. It shall state the name of the court~~,~~ _and_ the title of the\naction~~,~~ and shall command the attendance of the witness at a time and\nplace specified, until discharged.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to this Article is not intended to remove the authority of a\njustice of the peace to issue a summons pursuant to Article 4921.2.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1551. Pretrial and scheduling conference; order\n\nA. In any civil action in a district court _,_ the court may _,_ in its\ndiscretion _,_ direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for\nconferences _that may be conducted in chambers, by telephone, or by video\nteleconference_ to consider any of the following:\n\n(1) ~~The simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous\nclaims or defenses~~ _The setting of deadlines for the filing of a motion in\naccordance with Article 1425(F), motion for summary judgment, motion in\nlimine, and any other pretrial motion_.\n\n(2) _The setting of the trial and the deadline for the filing of any jury\nbond._\n\n_(3)_ The necessity or desirability of _, and the deadline for filing, any_\namendments to the pleadings.\n\n~~(3) What material facts and issues exist without substantial controversy,\nand what material facts and issues are actually and in good faith\ncontroverted.~~\n\n~~(4) Proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance\nrulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence.~~ _The simplification\nof the issues, including stipulations as to material facts, exhibits, and\nissues that are not disputed, and a determination of the facts, exhibits, and\nissues to be tried._\n\n(5) _The authenticity and admissibility of exhibits that a party intends to\nintroduce at trial, including a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of\nexhibits or the setting of a hearing date as to the admissibility of\nexhibits._\n\n_(a) If a party has reasonable suspicion that an opposing party 's exhibits\nare falsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall raise these concerns at the pretrial\nconference or at a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of the exhibits._\n\n_(b) If a party knows or has reason to know that its exhibits have been\nfalsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall disclose this fact in accordance with\nArticle 371._\n\n_(c) Subsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Subparagraph shall not apply to\ndemonstrative exhibits._\n\n~~(5)~~ (6) Limitations or restrictions on or regulation of the use of expert\ntestimony ~~under Louisiana~~ _pursuant to_ Code of Evidence Article 702.\n\n~~(6)~~ _(7)_ The control and scheduling of discovery including any issues\nrelating to disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information, and\nthe form or forms in which it should be produced.\n\n~~(7)~~ _(8)_ Any issues relating to claims of privilege or protection of\ntrial preparation material, and whether the court should include agreements\nbetween counsel relating to ~~such~~ _those_ issues in an order.\n\n~~(8)~~ _(9)_ The identification of witnesses, documents, and exhibits.\n\n~~(9) The presentation of testimony or other evidence by electronic devices.~~\n\n(10) _The setting of any trial, motion, or exception hearing by audiovisual\nmeans, or the presentation of any evidence or testimony by audiovisual means,\nin accordance with Article 195.1._\n\n_(11)_ ~~Such other~~ _Other_ matters ~~as~~ _that_ may aid in the disposition\nof the action.\n\nB.

The\nArticle's use of \"artificial intelligence\" is broad and encompasses the\nsuspected use of \"deepfakes\". R.S. 14:73:13 defines \"deepfake\" to mean \"any\naudio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered,\nor digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable\nobserver to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the\nindividual or replace an individual's likeness with another individual and\ndepicted in the recording.\" Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines\n\"deepfake\" to mean a \"false video, audio recording, or other medium that is\ngenerated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence,\nwith the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.\"\n\n(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory.

These deadlines aim to ensure that motions are filed, and hearing\ndates are set, in accordance with applicable law and in consideration of the\ncourt's calendar.\n\n(c) The requirements of this Article are not meant to supersede the\nrequirements of Article 1571\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1702.

All judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to\nwriting and signed by the court._\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) These amendments largely restore the Article to its pre-1997 form. The\nrevisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial\ncourt to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A\nof this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be\ntaken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a\nsupervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the\nsuccessful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate\nall of the issues in the case.\n\n(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former\nParagraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides\nfor interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).\nParagraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance\nwith this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus\nclearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ\nfrom a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C. See La. Ct. App.\nUnif. Rules 4-2 and 4-3 and Article 1914.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1974. Delay for applying for new trial\n\nA party may file a motion for a new trial not later than seven days, exclusive\nof legal holidays, after the clerk has mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or\nthe sheriff has served _,_ the notice of judgment as required by Article 1913.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2088. Divesting of jurisdiction of trial court\n\nA. The jurisdiction of the trial court over all matters in the case reviewable\nunder the appeal is divested, and that of the appellate court attaches, on the\ngranting of the order of appeal and the timely filing of the appeal bond, in\nthe case of a suspensive appeal _,_ or on the granting of the order of appeal,\nin the case of a devolutive appeal. Thereafter, the trial court has\njurisdiction in the case only over those matters not reviewable under the\nappeal, including the right to do any of the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(11) ~~Certify a partial judgment or partial summary judgment in accordance\nwith Article 1915(B).~~\n\n~~(12)~~ Amend a judgment to provide proper decretal language ~~under~~ _in\naccordance with_ Article 1918 or 1951.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2595. Trial; decision\n\n_A._ Upon reasonable notice a summary proceeding ~~may be tried in open court\nor in chambers, in term or in vacation; and~~ shall be tried by preference\nover ordinary proceedings, and without a jury, except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.\n\n_B._ The court shall render its decision as soon as practicable after the\nconclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and, whenever practicable,\nwithout taking the matter under advisement.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4607. Partition by licitation or by private sale\n\nWhen a partition is to be made by licitation, the sale shall be conducted at\npublic auction and after the advertisements required for judicial sales under\nexecution. When a partition is to be made at private sale without the consent\nof all co-owners, the sale shall be for not less than the appraised value of\nthe property, and documents required pursuant to a court order shall be\nexecuted on behalf of the absentee or nonconsenting co-owner by a court-\nappointed representative, who may be a co-owner, after the advertisements\nrequired for judicial sales under execution are made. All counsel of record,\nincluding ~~curators~~ _attorneys_ appointed to represent absentee defendants,\nand persons appearing in proper person shall be given notice of the sale date.\nAt any time prior to the sale, the parties may agree upon a nonjudicial\npartition.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4873. Transfer to district court; procedure; contest; effect\n\nA party entitled thereto under the provisions of Article 4872 may transfer the\naction to the district court in the following manner:\n\n(1) Within the delay allowed for answer in the trial court of the limited\njurisdiction, or within ten days after answer has been filed, ~~he~~ _the\nparty_ shall file a motion to transfer with the clerk of the court in which\nthe suit is pending. The motion shall include a declaration that the matter is\none to which _the_ defendant would have been entitled to _a_ trial by jury if\ncommenced in district court, and that _the_ defendant desires _a_ trial by\njury. If a party fails to file a motion to transfer within the delays required\nby this Subparagraph, the matter shall not be transferred.\n\n(2) _A plaintiff may oppose the transfer of the action to a district court\nonly if the plaintiff stipulates that the action does not exceed ten thousand\ndollars exclusive of interest and costs._\n\n~~(2)~~ _(3)_ If no opposition is filed within ten days after the filing of\nthe motion to transfer, the judge of the court in which the suit is pending\nshall order the transfer to the district court. If an opposition is timely\nfiled, it shall be tried summarily.\n\n~~(3)~~ _(4)(a)_ Where a transfer is ordered, the clerk of the court in which\nthe action was initially filed shall forward to the clerk of _the_ court to\nwhich the action is transferred a certified copy of the record in the initial\ncourt, including pleadings, minute entries, and all other proceedings.\n\n_(b)_ The clerk of the district court shall file the action as a new\nproceeding in that court, upon payment by the defendant of a filing fee as\nprovided by rule of the district court. All costs accruing thereafter,\nhowever, shall be advanced in the same manner as though the action\n~~initially~~ had _initially_ been commenced in the district court by the\noriginal plaintiff.\n\n~~(4)~~ _(5)_ When the matter is docketed by the clerk of the district court,\nthe proceeding shall continue in that court as though originally commenced\ntherein. In the event _that_ transfer is effected prior to answer, _the_\ndefendant shall file ~~his~~ _the_ answer in the district court within the\ndelays provided by Article 1001, commencing from the date _on which_ the\ntransferred proceeding is filed in that court.\n\n~~(5)~~ _(6)_ The disposition of a motion to transfer and any opposition\nthereto shall not be appealable, but shall be reviewable through the exercise\nof its supervisory jurisdiction by the court of appeal having appellate\njurisdiction over the case.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 5059. Computation of time\n\nA. In computing a period of time allowed or prescribed by law or by order of\ncourt, the date of the act, event, or default ~~after~~ _from_ which the\nperiod begins to run is not ~~to be~~ included. The last day of the period is\n~~to be~~ included, unless it is a legal holiday, in which event the period\nruns until the end of the next day ~~which~~ _that_ is not a legal holiday.\n\nB. _The \"next day\" as set forth in Paragraph A of this Article means the\nsubsequent calendar day that is not a legal holiday following a legal\nholiday._\n\n~~B.~~ _C._ A half-holiday is considered ~~as~~ a legal holiday. A legal\nholiday is ~~to be~~ included in the computation of a period of time allowed\nor prescribed, except when:\n\n(1) It is expressly excluded~~;~~ _._\n\n(2) It would otherwise be the last day of the period~~; or~~ _._\n\n(3) The period is less than seven days.\n\n~~C.~~ _D._(1) A legal holiday shall be excluded in the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by an agency in the executive\nbranch of state government.\n\n(2) Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph shall not apply to the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by the Department of Revenue,\nthe Department of Environmental Quality, or the Department of Insurance\nrelative to examination reports in R.S. 22:1983.\n\nComments -2025\n\nThe revisions to this Article clarify existing law and conform to the\ncomputation of time set forth in Becnel v. Northrop Grumman Ship Systems,\nInc., 18 So. 3d 1269 (La. 2009) and Article 966(B)(4). Paragraph B of this\nArticle makes clear that if the last day in a period of time allowed or\nprescribed by law or court order falls on a legal holiday, the period runs\nuntil the subsequent, later-in-time calendar day that is not a legal holiday.\nFor example, if the legal deadline to file a pretrial motion is due sixty days\nprior to trial and that day is a Saturday, the motion is not due until the\nsubsequent Monday as long as that Monday is not a legal holiday.\n\nSection 4. Code of Civil Procedure Articles74.2(F), 2088(A)(12), and 3784 are\nhereby repealed in their entirety.\n\nSection 5. The provisions of Civil Code Article 3462 as amended by Section 1\nof this Act shall not apply to actions that have prescribed prior to the\neffective date of this Act.\n\nSection 6. The provisions of Article 1915 as amended by Section 3 of this Act\nshall have prospective application only and shall not apply to appeals and\nsupervisory writs filed prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\nDIGEST\n\nThe digest printed below was prepared by House Legislative Services.

Louisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of lack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in a criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not interdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim. Under the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal proceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a civil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person&#39;s limited interdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full interdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less restrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not deprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of limited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue.

The revisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial court to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A of this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be taken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a supervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former Paragraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides for interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C). Paragraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus clearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ from a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C.

Civil Code Article 3462 is hereby amended and reenacted to read as\nfollows:\n\nArt. 3462. Interruption by filing of ~~suit~~ _action_ or by service of\nprocess\n\n~~Prescription~~ _Unless otherwise expressly provided by legislation,\nprescription_ is interrupted when ~~the owner commences action against the\npossessor, or when the obligee commences action against the obligor,~~ _an\naction is commenced_ in a court of competent jurisdiction ~~and venue~~. If\n_an_ action is commenced in ~~an incompetent court, or in an improper venue,~~\n_a court without competent jurisdiction,_ prescription is interrupted only as\nto a defendant served by process within the prescriptive period.\n\nRevision Comments - 2025\n\nThis amendment changes the law. The filing of an action in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is\nimproper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still\nrequire an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and\nproper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604\n(professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606\n(professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer,\nsurveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability),\nand 5608 (action against home inspectors).\n\nSection 2. Code of Civil Procedure Article 863(F) is hereby amended and\nreenacted to read as follows:\n\nArt. 863. Signing of pleadings; effect\n\n* * *\n\nF. A sanction authorized in Paragraph D _of this Article_ shall not be imposed\nwith respect to an original petition ~~which~~ _that_ is filed within sixty\ndays of an applicable prescriptive date and then voluntarily dismissed _or\ntransferred to a court of proper venue_ within ninety days after its filing or\non the date of a hearing on the pleading, whichever is earlier.\n\n* * *\n\nSection 3.

Custody proceedings; support; forum non conveniens\n\n* * *\n\nE. For the convenience of the parties and the witnesses and in the interest of\njustice, a court, upon contradictory motion or upon its own motion after\nnotice and hearing, may transfer the custody or support proceeding to another\ncourt where the proceeding ~~might~~ _may_ have been brought.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 371. Attorney\n\n_A._ An attorney ~~at law~~ is an officer of the court. ~~He~~ _An attorney_\nshall ~~conduct himself~~ at all times _act_ with decorum, and in a manner\nconsistent with the dignity and authority of the court and the role ~~which he\nhimself~~ _that the attorney_ should play in the administration of justice.\n\n_B._ ~~He~~ _An attorney_ shall treat _the_ court, its officers, jurors,\nwitnesses, the opposing party, and opposing counsel with due respect; shall\nnot interrupt opposing counsel~~,~~ or otherwise interfere with or impede the\norderly dispatch of judicial business by the court; shall not knowingly\nencourage or produce false evidence _, including evidence that is artificially\ngenerated or altered by any means_ ; and shall not knowingly make any\nmisrepresentation, or otherwise impose upon or deceive the court.\n\n_C. An attorney shall exercise reasonable diligence to verify the authenticity\nof evidence before offering it to the court. If an attorney knew or should\nhave known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that evidence was\nfalse or artificially manipulated, the offering of that evidence without\ndisclosure of that fact shall be considered a violation of this Article._\n\n_D._ For a violation of any of the provisions of this ~~article~~ _Article_ ,\nthe attorney ~~at law subjects himself~~ _is subject_ to punishment for\ncontempt of court~~,~~ and ~~such~~ further disciplinary action as is\notherwise provided by law.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 684. ~~Mental incompetent; interdict~~ _Interdict_\n\nA. ~~A mental incompetent~~ _A person fully interdicted or a person whose\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the procedural capacity to sue_\ndoes not have the procedural capacity to sue.\n\nB. Except as otherwise provided in Articles 4431, 4554, and 4566, the curator\nis the proper plaintiff to sue to enforce a right of ~~an interdict~~ _a\nperson fully interdicted or a person whose limited interdiction specifically\nrestricts the procedural capacity to sue_.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThis amendment seeks to address an issue raised by the court in Walcott v.\nLouisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1\nCir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of\nlack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in\na criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not\ninterdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim.\nUnder the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal\nproceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a\ncivil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person's limited\ninterdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full\ninterdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less\nrestrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not\ndeprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article\n4551 and Civil Code Article 390.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception A. The objections that may\nbe raised through the peremptory exception include but are not limited to the\nfollowing:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No cause of action _, including an objection of no cause of action in\npart, as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or\ntheories against a party, whether in an original demand, reconventional\ndemand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or intervention_.\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nSubparagraph (A)(5) of this Article was amended to clarify that a partial\njudgment sustaining an exception raising the objection of no cause of action\nmay be appropriate when two or more actions based on the same operative facts\nof a single transaction or occurrence are cumulated. This changes the result\nreached by the Louisiana Supreme Court in Everything on Wheels Subaru, Inc. v.\nSubaru South., Inc., 616 So. 2d 1234 (La. 1993).\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 966. Motion for summary judgment; procedure\n\n* * *\n\nB. Unless extended by the court and agreed to by all of the parties, a motion\nfor summary judgment shall be filed, opposed, or replied to in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) ~~Notwithstanding Article 1915(B)(2), the~~ _The_ court shall not\nreconsider or revise the granting of a motion for partial summary judgment on\nmotion of a party who failed to meet the deadlines imposed by this Paragraph,\nnor shall the court consider any documents filed after those deadlines.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1201. Citation; waiver; delay for service\n\n* * *\n\nC. Service of the citation shall be requested on all named defendants within\nninety days of commencement of the action. When a supplemental or amended\npetition is filed naming any additional defendant, service of citation shall\nbe requested within ninety days of its filing, and the additional defendant\nshall be served with the original petition and the supplemental or amended\npetition. The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph\nby any written waiver. The requirement provided by this Paragraph shall be\nexpressly waived by a defendant unless the defendant files, in accordance with\nthe provisions of Article 928, a declinatory exception of insufficiency of\nservice of process specifically alleging the failure to timely request service\nof citation _or a contradictory motion in accordance with Article 1672(C)_.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1313. Service by mail, delivery, or electronic means\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, every pleading subsequent to the\noriginal petition, and every pleading which under an express provision of law\nmay be served as provided in this Article, may be served either by the sheriff\nor by:\n\n* * *\n\n(4) Transmitting a copy by electronic means to counsel of record, or if there\nis no counsel of record, to the adverse party, at the number or addresses\nexpressly designated in a pleading or other writing for receipt of electronic\nservice. Service by electronic means is complete upon transmission but is not\neffective and shall not be certified if the serving party learns _that_ the\ntransmission did not reach the party to be served. _If electronic service\ncannot be effected in accordance with this Subparagraph, service may be\neffected in accordance with other provisions of this Paragraph._\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to Subparagraph (A)(4) of this Article clarifies that if service\ncannot be effected by electronic means, service may be effected in accordance\nwith the other provisions of Paragraph A. See Article 966(B)(1) and (2)\nproviding that a motion for summary judgment, all documents in support of the\nmotion, any opposition to the motion, and all documents in support of the\nopposition shall be filed and served in accordance with Subparagraph (A)(4) of\nthis Article.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1351. Issuance; form\n\nThe clerk ~~or judge~~ of the court wherein the action is pending, at the\nrequest of _the court or_ a party, shall issue subpoenas for the attendance of\nwitnesses at hearings or trials. A subpoena shall issue under the seal of the\ncourt. It shall state the name of the court~~,~~ _and_ the title of the\naction~~,~~ and shall command the attendance of the witness at a time and\nplace specified, until discharged.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to this Article is not intended to remove the authority of a\njustice of the peace to issue a summons pursuant to Article 4921.2.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1551. Pretrial and scheduling conference; order\n\nA. In any civil action in a district court _,_ the court may _,_ in its\ndiscretion _,_ direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for\nconferences _that may be conducted in chambers, by telephone, or by video\nteleconference_ to consider any of the following:\n\n(1) ~~The simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous\nclaims or defenses~~ _The setting of deadlines for the filing of a motion in\naccordance with Article 1425(F), motion for summary judgment, motion in\nlimine, and any other pretrial motion_.\n\n(2) _The setting of the trial and the deadline for the filing of any jury\nbond._\n\n_(3)_ The necessity or desirability of _, and the deadline for filing, any_\namendments to the pleadings.\n\n~~(3) What material facts and issues exist without substantial controversy,\nand what material facts and issues are actually and in good faith\ncontroverted.~~\n\n~~(4) Proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance\nrulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence.~~ _The simplification\nof the issues, including stipulations as to material facts, exhibits, and\nissues that are not disputed, and a determination of the facts, exhibits, and\nissues to be tried._\n\n(5) _The authenticity and admissibility of exhibits that a party intends to\nintroduce at trial, including a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of\nexhibits or the setting of a hearing date as to the admissibility of\nexhibits._\n\n_(a) If a party has reasonable suspicion that an opposing party 's exhibits\nare falsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall raise these concerns at the pretrial\nconference or at a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of the exhibits._\n\n_(b) If a party knows or has reason to know that its exhibits have been\nfalsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall disclose this fact in accordance with\nArticle 371._\n\n_(c) Subsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Subparagraph shall not apply to\ndemonstrative exhibits._\n\n~~(5)~~ (6) Limitations or restrictions on or regulation of the use of expert\ntestimony ~~under Louisiana~~ _pursuant to_ Code of Evidence Article 702.\n\n~~(6)~~ _(7)_ The control and scheduling of discovery including any issues\nrelating to disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information, and\nthe form or forms in which it should be produced.\n\n~~(7)~~ _(8)_ Any issues relating to claims of privilege or protection of\ntrial preparation material, and whether the court should include agreements\nbetween counsel relating to ~~such~~ _those_ issues in an order.\n\n~~(8)~~ _(9)_ The identification of witnesses, documents, and exhibits.\n\n~~(9) The presentation of testimony or other evidence by electronic devices.~~\n\n(10) _The setting of any trial, motion, or exception hearing by audiovisual\nmeans, or the presentation of any evidence or testimony by audiovisual means,\nin accordance with Article 195.1._\n\n_(11)_ ~~Such other~~ _Other_ matters ~~as~~ _that_ may aid in the disposition\nof the action.\n\nB. The court shall render an order ~~which~~ _that_ recites the action taken\nat the conference~~, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the\nagreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and which\nlimits the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or\nagreements of counsel~~ _pursuant to Paragraph A of this Article_. ~~Such~~\n_The_ order ~~controls~~ _shall control_ the subsequent course of the action,\nunless modified ~~at the trial~~ _by the court_ to prevent manifest injustice.\n\n_C.(1) In all actions in which a party intends to file the affidavit of an\nexpert in a summary judgment proceeding or call upon an expert to serve as a\nwitness at a hearing or trial, upon notice from a party, the court shall\nconduct a pretrial or scheduling conference and shall issue an order\nestablishing deadlines for the following:_\n\n_(a) The identification of the expert._\n\n_(b) The production of the report of the expert._\n\n_(c) The filing of any motion in accordance with Article 1425(F), the hearing\ndate of the motion, and the ruling date by the trial court._\n\n_(d) The filing of any motion for summary judgment and the hearing date of the\nmotion._\n\n_(e) The trial date._\n\n_(2) This Paragraph does not apply to testimony in an action for divorce or\nannulment of marriage, to a separation in a covenant marriage, to a property\npartition, to an administration of a succession, or to testimony in any\nincidental or ancillary proceedings or matters arising from those actions._\n\n~~C.~~ _D._ If a party's attorney fails to obey a pretrial order, or to appear\nat the pretrial and scheduling conference, or is substantially unprepared to\nparticipate in the conference or fails to participate in good faith, the\ncourt, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, after hearing, may make\n~~such~~ orders as are just, including orders provided in Article 1471 _(A)_\n(2), (3), and (4). In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the court\nmay require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay\nthe reasonable expenses incurred by noncompliance with this Paragraph,\nincluding attorney fees.\n\n~~D.~~ _E._ If a suit has been pending for more than one year since the date\nof ~~filing~~ _service_ of the original petition _on all defendants_ and no\ntrial date has been assigned, upon motion of any party, the court shall set\nthe matter for conference for the purpose of resolving all matters subject to\nthe provisions of this Article, including the scheduling of discovery,\nassignment for trial, and any other matters that will expedite the resolution\nof the suit. ~~The conference may be conducted in chambers, by telephone, or\nby video teleconference.~~\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) Subparagraph (A)(5) of this Article requires that the parties address at a\npretrial conference or hearing the authenticity and admissibility of exhibits\nthat are suspected to have been created, altered, or manipulated. The\nArticle's use of \"artificial intelligence\" is broad and encompasses the\nsuspected use of \"deepfakes\". R.S. 14:73:13 defines \"deepfake\" to mean \"any\naudio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered,\nor digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable\nobserver to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the\nindividual or replace an individual's likeness with another individual and\ndepicted in the recording.\" Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines\n\"deepfake\" to mean a \"false video, audio recording, or other medium that is\ngenerated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence,\nwith the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.\"\n\n(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory. To resolve the many\nissues with respect to the timing of challenging an expert's qualifications or\nmethodologies, the court shall either provide for deadlines in a pretrial or\nscheduling order in accordance with Paragraph A of this Article or, upon being\nnotified by a party that it intends to use an expert in a summary judgment\nproceeding or at trial, issue an order in accordance with Paragraph C of this\nArticle. These deadlines aim to ensure that motions are filed, and hearing\ndates are set, in accordance with applicable law and in consideration of the\ncourt's calendar.\n\n(c) The requirements of this Article are not meant to supersede the\nrequirements of Article 1571\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1702. Default judgment A.\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No default judgment shall be rendered against a defendant when notice is\nrequired ~~under~~ _pursuant to_ Subparagraph (2) or (3) of this Paragraph\nunless ~~proof of~~ the required notice is ~~made in the manner provided by\nR.S. 13:3205.~~ _given in accordance with any of the following:_\n\n_(a) By mailing the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the\nplaintiff shall provide proof that the notice was enclosed in an envelope\nproperly addressed to the defendant or attorney, with sufficient postage\naffixed, and the date on which it was deposited in the United States mail, and\nthe plaintiff shall file the return receipt of the defendant or attorney._\n\n_(b) By utilizing the services of a commercial courier to make delivery of the\nnotice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the plaintiff shall provide\nproof of the name of the commercial courier, the date, and the address at\nwhich the notice was delivered to the defendant or attorney, and the plaintiff\nshall file the commercial courier 's confirmation of delivery._\n\n_(c) By actual delivery of the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which\ncase the plaintiff shall provide proof of the date, place, and manner of\ndelivery._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1811. Motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict\n\nA.(1) Not later than seven days, exclusive of legal holidays, after the clerk\nhas mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or the sheriff has served _,_ the\nnotice of judgment ~~under~~ _in accordance with_ Article 1913, a party may\nmove for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. If a verdict was not\nreturned, a party may move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict not\nlater than seven days, exclusive of legal holidays, after the jury was\ndischarged.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1911. Final judgment; ~~partial final judgment;~~ signing; appeals\n\n* * *\n\nB. For the purpose of an appeal as provided in Article 2083, no appeal ~~may~~\n_shall_ be taken from a final judgment until the ~~requirement of this Article\nhas been fulfilled~~ _judgment has been signed by the judge_. ~~No appeal may\nbe taken from a partial final judgment under Article 1915(B) until the\njudgment has been designated a final judgment under Article 1915(B). An appeal\nmay be taken from a final judgment under Article 1915(A) without the judgment\nbeing so designated.~~\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1913. Notice of judgment\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the signing of a final\njudgment~~, including a partial final judgment under Article 1915,~~ is\nrequired in all contested cases~~,~~ and shall be mailed _or delivered in open\ncourt_ by the clerk of court to the counsel of record for each party, and to\neach party not represented by counsel. _Delivery of the signed judgment in\nopen court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be documented in the\nrecord of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nC. Except when service is required ~~under~~ _in accordance with_ Paragraph B\nof this Article, notice of the signing of a default judgment shall be mailed\nby the clerk of court to the defendant at the address where personal service\nwas obtained or to the last known address of the defendant.\n\nD. The clerk shall file a certificate in the record showing the date on which,\nand the counsel and parties to whom, notice of the signing of the judgment was\nmailed _or delivered in open court_.\n\nArt. 1914. Interlocutory judgments; notice; delay for further action\n\n* * *\n\nB. The interlocutory judgment shall be reduced to writing if the court so\norders, if a party requests within ten days of rendition in open court that it\nbe reduced to writing, _if a judgment is granted or an exception is sustained\nin accordance with Article 1915(C),_ or if the court takes the interlocutory\nmatter under advisement. The clerk shall mail _or deliver in open court_\nnotice of the ~~subsequent~~ judgment to each party. _Delivery of the signed\njudgment in open court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be\ndocumented in the record of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nD. Except as provided in Paragraph C of this Article, each party shall have\nten days either from notice of the interlocutory judgment, or from the mailing\nof notice when required to take any action or file any pleadings in the trial\ncourt; ~~however, this~~ _. This_ provision does not suspend or otherwise\naffect the time for applying for supervisory writs, nor does it affect the\ntime for appealing an interlocutory judgment ~~under~~ _in accordance with_\nArticle 2083.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1915. ~~Partial final judgment~~ _Final and interlocutory judgments_ ;\npartial judgment; partial exception; partial summary judgment A.\n\nA final judgment may be rendered ~~and signed by the court~~ , even though it\nmay not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for, or\nmay not adjudicate all of the issues in the case, when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to ~~less~~ _fewer_ than all of the parties,\ndefendants, ~~third party~~ _third-party_ plaintiffs, ~~third party~~ _third-\nparty_ defendants, or ~~intervenors~~ _interveners_.\n\n* * *\n\n(4) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on either the principal or incidental\ndemand, when the two have been tried separately, as provided by Article 1038.\n\n(5) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on the issue of liability when that issue\nhas been tried separately by the court, or when, in a jury trial, the issue of\nliability has been tried before a jury and the issue of damages is to be tried\nbefore a different jury.\n\n* * *\n\n~~B.(1) When a court renders a partial judgment or partial summary judgment or\nsustains an exception in part, as to one or more but less than all of the\nclaims, demands, issues, or theories against a party, whether in an original\ndemand, reconventional demand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or\nintervention, the judgment shall not constitute a final judgment unless it is\ndesignated as a final judgment by the court after an express determination\nthat there is no just reason for delay.~~\n\n~~(2) In the absence of such a determination and designation, any such order\nor decision shall not constitute a final judgment for the purpose of an\nimmediate appeal and may be revised at any time prior to rendition of the\njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the\nparties.~~\n\n~~C.~~ _B._ If an appeal is taken from any judgment rendered ~~under the\nprovisions of~~ _in accordance with Paragraph A_ this Article, the trial court\nshall retain jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining issues in the case.\n\n_C. Except as otherwise provided by law, when a court grants a judgment or\nsummary judgment, or sustains an exception in part, as to one or more but\nfewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or theories by or against a\nparty, whether in an original demand, reconventional demand, cross-claim,\nthird-party claim, or intervention, that judgment is an interlocutory\njudgment._\n\n_D. All judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to\nwriting and signed by the court._\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) These amendments largely restore the Article to its pre-1997 form. The\nrevisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial\ncourt to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A\nof this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be\ntaken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a\nsupervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the\nsuccessful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate\nall of the issues in the case.\n\n(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former\nParagraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides\nfor interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).\nParagraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance\nwith this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus\nclearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ\nfrom a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C. See La. Ct. App.\nUnif. Rules 4-2 and 4-3 and Article 1914.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1974. Delay for applying for new trial\n\nA party may file a motion for a new trial not later than seven days, exclusive\nof legal holidays, after the clerk has mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or\nthe sheriff has served _,_ the notice of judgment as required by Article 1913.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2088.

Northrop Grumman Ship Systems,\nInc., 18 So. 3d 1269 (La. 2009) and Article 966(B)(4). Paragraph B of this\nArticle makes clear that if the last day in a period of time allowed or\nprescribed by law or court order falls on a legal holiday, the period runs\nuntil the subsequent, later-in-time calendar day that is not a legal holiday.\nFor example, if the legal deadline to file a pretrial motion is due sixty days\nprior to trial and that day is a Saturday, the motion is not due until the\nsubsequent Monday as long as that Monday is not a legal holiday.\n\nSection 4. Code of Civil Procedure Articles74.2(F), 2088(A)(12), and 3784 are\nhereby repealed in their entirety.\n\nSection 5. The provisions of Civil Code Article 3462 as amended by Section 1\nof this Act shall not apply to actions that have prescribed prior to the\neffective date of this Act.\n\nSection 6. The provisions of Article 1915 as amended by Section 3 of this Act\nshall have prospective application only and shall not apply to appeals and\nsupervisory writs filed prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\nDIGEST\n\nThe digest printed below was prepared by House Legislative Services.

Louisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of lack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in a criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not interdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim. Under the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal proceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a civil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person&#39;s limited interdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full interdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less restrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not deprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of limited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article 4551 and Civil Code Article 390.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">* * *</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Art. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A.

The revisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial court to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A of this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be taken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a supervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former Paragraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides for interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).

Civil Code Article 3462 is hereby amended and reenacted to read as\nfollows:\n\nArt. 3462. Interruption by filing of ~~suit~~ _action_ or by service of\nprocess\n\n~~Prescription~~ _Unless otherwise expressly provided by legislation,\nprescription_ is interrupted when the owner commences action against the\npossessor, or when the obligee commences action against the obligor, in a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction and venue. If action is commenced in an\nincompetent court, or in an improper venue, prescription is interrupted only\nas to a defendant served by process within the prescriptive period. _If an\naction is commenced in a competent court of improper venue, prescription is\nsuspended for a period of seven days as to a defendant not served by process\nwithin the prescriptive period._\n\nRevision Comments - 2025\n\nThis amendment changes the law. The filing of an action in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is\nimproper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still\nrequire an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and\nproper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604\n(professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606\n(professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer,\nsurveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability),\nand 5608 (action against home inspectors).\n\nSection 2.

Custody proceedings; support; forum non conveniens\n\n* * *\n\nE. For the convenience of the parties and the witnesses and in the interest of\njustice, a court, upon contradictory motion or upon its own motion after\nnotice and hearing, may transfer the custody or support proceeding to another\ncourt where the proceeding ~~might~~ _may_ have been brought.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 371. Attorney\n\n_A._ An attorney ~~at law~~ is an officer of the court. ~~He~~ _An attorney_\nshall ~~conduct himself~~ at all times _act_ with decorum~~,~~ and in a manner\nconsistent with the dignity and authority of the court and the role ~~which he\nhimself~~ _that the attorney_ should play in the administration of justice.\n\n_B._ ~~He~~ _An attorney_ shall treat the court, its officers, jurors,\nwitnesses, _the_ opposing party, and opposing counsel with due respect; shall\nnot interrupt opposing counsel~~,~~ or otherwise interfere with or impede the\norderly dispatch of judicial business by the court; shall not knowingly\nencourage or produce false evidence _, including evidence that is artificially\ngenerated or altered by any means_ ; and shall not knowingly make any\nmisrepresentation, or otherwise impose upon or deceive the court.\n\n_C. An attorney shall exercise reasonable diligence to verify the authenticity\nof evidence before offering it to the court. If an attorney knew or should\nhave known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that evidence was\nfalse or artificially manipulated, the offering of that evidence without\ndisclosure of that fact shall be considered a violation of this Article._\n\n_D._ For a violation of any of the provisions of this ~~article~~ _Article_ ,\nthe attorney ~~at law subjects himself~~ _is subject_ to punishment for\ncontempt of court~~,~~ and ~~such~~ further disciplinary action as is\notherwise provided by law.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 684. ~~Mental incompetent; interdict~~ _Interdict_\n\nA. ~~A mental incompetent~~ _A person fully interdicted or a person whose\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the procedural capacity to sue_\ndoes not have the procedural capacity to sue.\n\nB. Except as otherwise provided in Articles 4431, 4554, and 4566, the curator\nis the proper plaintiff to sue to enforce a right of ~~an interdict~~ _a\nperson fully interdicted or a person whose limited interdiction specifically\nrestricts the procedural capacity to sue_.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThis amendment seeks to address an issue raised by the court in Walcott v.\nLouisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1\nCir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of\nlack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in\na criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not\ninterdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim.\nUnder the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal\nproceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a\ncivil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person's limited\ninterdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full\ninterdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less\nrestrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not\ndeprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article\n4551 and Civil Code Article 390.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception\n\nA.

This changes the result\nreached by the Louisiana Supreme Court in Everything on Wheels Subaru, Inc. v.\nSubaru South., Inc., 616 So. 2d 1234 (La. 1993).\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 966. Motion for summary judgment; procedure\n\n* * *\n\nB. Unless extended by the court and agreed to by all of the parties, a motion\nfor summary judgment shall be filed, opposed, or replied to in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) ~~Notwithstanding Article 1915(B)(2), the~~ _The_ court shall not\nreconsider or revise the granting of a motion for partial summary judgment on\nmotion of a party who failed to meet the deadlines imposed by this Paragraph,\nnor shall the court consider any documents filed after those deadlines.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1201.

When a supplemental or amended\npetition is filed naming any additional defendant, service of citation shall\nbe requested within ninety days of its filing, and the additional defendant\nshall be served with the original petition and the supplemental or amended\npetition. The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph\nby any written waiver.

Service by electronic means is complete upon transmission but is not\neffective and shall not be certified if the serving party learns _that_ the\ntransmission did not reach the party to be served. _If electronic service\ncannot be effected in accordance with this Subparagraph, service may be\neffected in accordance with other provisions of this Paragraph._\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to Subparagraph (A)(4) of this Article clarifies that if service\ncannot be effected by electronic means, service may be effected in accordance\nwith the other provisions of Paragraph A.

The court shall render an order ~~which~~ _that_ recites the action taken\nat the conference~~, the amendments allowed to the pleadings, and the\nagreements made by the parties as to any of the matters considered, and which\nlimits the issues for trial to those not disposed of by admissions or\nagreements of counsel~~ _pursuant to Paragraph A of this Article_. ~~Such~~\n_The_ order ~~controls~~ _shall control_ the subsequent course of the action,\nunless modified ~~at the trial~~ _by the court_ to prevent manifest injustice.\n\n_C.(1) In all actions in which a party intends to file the affidavit of an\nexpert in a summary judgment proceeding or call upon an expert to serve as a\nwitness at a hearing or trial, upon notice from a party, the court shall\nconduct a pretrial or scheduling conference and shall issue an order\nestablishing deadlines for the following:_\n\n_(a) The identification of the expert._\n\n_(b) The production of the report of the expert._\n\n_(c) The filing of any motion in accordance with Article 1425(F), the hearing\ndate of the motion, and the ruling date by the trial court._\n\n_(d) The filing of any motion for summary judgment and the hearing date of the\nmotion._\n\n_(e) The trial date._\n\n_(2) This Paragraph does not apply to testimony in an action for divorce or\nannulment of marriage, to a separation in a covenant marriage, to a property\npartition, to an administration of a succession, or to testimony in any\nincidental or ancillary proceedings or matters arising from those actions._\n\n~~C.~~ _D._ If a party's attorney fails to obey a pretrial order, or to appear\nat the pretrial and scheduling conference, or is substantially unprepared to\nparticipate in the conference or fails to participate in good faith, the\ncourt, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, after hearing, may make\n~~such~~ orders as are just, including orders provided in Article 1471 _(A)_\n(2), (3), and (4).

The\nArticle's use of \"artificial intelligence\" is broad and encompasses the\nsuspected use of \"deepfakes\". R.S. 14:73:13 defines \"deepfake\" to mean \"any\naudio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered,\nor digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable\nobserver to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the\nindividual or replace an individual's likeness with another individual and\ndepicted in the recording.\" Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines\n\"deepfake\" to mean a \"false video, audio recording, or other medium that is\ngenerated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence,\nwith the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.\"\n\n(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory. To resolve the many\nissues with respect to the timing of challenging an expert's qualifications or\nmethodologies, the court shall either provide for deadlines in a pretrial or\nscheduling order in accordance with Paragraph A of this Article or, upon being\nnotified by a party that it intends to use an expert in a summary judgment\nproceeding or at trial, issue an order in accordance with Paragraph C of this\nArticle. These deadlines aim to ensure that motions are filed, and hearing\ndates are set, in accordance with applicable law and in consideration of the\ncourt's calendar.\n\n(c) The requirements of this Article are not meant to supersede the\nrequirements of Article 1571\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1702. Default judgment\n\nA.\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No default judgment shall be rendered against a defendant when notice is\nrequired ~~under~~ _pursuant to_ Subparagraph (2) or (3) of this Paragraph\nunless ~~proof of~~ the required notice is ~~made in the manner provided by\nR.S. 13:3205.~~ _given in accordance with any of the following:_\n\n_(a) By mailing the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the\nplaintiff shall provide proof that the notice was enclosed in an envelope\nproperly addressed to the defendant or attorney, with sufficient postage\naffixed, and the date on which it was deposited in the United States mail, and\nthe plaintiff shall file the return receipt of the defendant or attorney._\n\n_(b) By utilizing the services of a commercial courier to make delivery of the\nnotice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the plaintiff shall provide\nproof of the name of the commercial courier, the date, and the address at\nwhich the notice was delivered to the defendant or attorney, and the plaintiff\nshall file the commercial courier 's confirmation of delivery._\n\n_(c) By actual delivery of the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which\ncase the plaintiff shall provide proof of the date, place, and manner of\ndelivery._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1811.

If a verdict was not\nreturned, a party may move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict not\nlater than seven days, exclusive of legal holidays, after the jury was\ndischarged.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1911. Final judgment; ~~partial final judgment;~~ signing; appeals\n\n* * *\n\nB. For the purpose of an appeal as provided in Article 2083, no appeal ~~may~~\n_shall_ be taken from a final judgment until the ~~requirement of this Article\nhas been fulfilled~~ _judgment has been signed by the judge_. ~~No appeal may\nbe taken from a partial final judgment under Article 1915(B) until the\njudgment has been designated a final judgment under Article 1915(B). An appeal\nmay be taken from a final judgment under Article 1915(A) without the judgment\nbeing so designated.~~\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1913. Notice of judgment\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the signing of a final\njudgment~~, including a partial final judgment under Article 1915,~~ is\nrequired in all contested cases, and shall be mailed _or delivered in open\ncourt_ by the clerk of court to the counsel of record for each party, and to\neach party not represented by counsel. _Delivery of the signed judgment in\nopen court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be documented in the\nrecord of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nC. Except when service is required ~~under~~ _in accordance with_ Paragraph B\nof this Article, notice of the signing of a default judgment shall be mailed\nby the clerk of court to the defendant at the address where personal service\nwas obtained or to the last known address of the defendant.\n\nD. The clerk shall file a certificate in the record showing the date on which,\nand the counsel and parties to whom, notice of the signing of the judgment was\nmailed _or delivered in open court_.\n\nArt. 1914. Interlocutory judgments; notice; delay for further action\n\n* * *\n\nB. The interlocutory judgment shall be reduced to writing if the court so\norders, if a party requests within ten days of rendition in open court that it\nbe reduced to writing, _if a judgment is granted or an exception is sustained\nin accordance with Article 1915(C),_ or if the court takes the interlocutory\nmatter under advisement. The clerk shall mail _or deliver in open court_\nnotice of the ~~subsequent~~ judgment to each party. _Delivery of the signed\njudgment in open court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be\ndocumented in the record of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nD. Except as provided in Paragraph C of this Article, each party shall have\nten days either from notice of the interlocutory judgment~~,~~ or from the\nmailing of notice when required to take any action or file any pleadings in\nthe trial court~~; however, this~~ _. This_ provision does not suspend or\notherwise affect the time for applying for supervisory writs, nor does it\naffect the time for appealing an interlocutory judgment ~~under~~ _in\naccordance with_ Article 2083.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1915. ~~Partial final judgment~~ _Final and interlocutory judgments_ ;\npartial judgment; partial exception; partial summary judgment\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered ~~and signed by the court~~ , even though\nit may not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for,\nor may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case, when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to ~~less~~ _fewer_ than all of the parties,\ndefendants, ~~third party~~ _third-party_ plaintiffs, ~~third party~~ _third-\nparty_ defendants, or ~~intervenors~~ _interveners_.\n\n* * *\n\n(4) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on either the principal or incidental\ndemand, when the two have been tried separately, as provided by Article 1038.\n\n(5) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on the issue of liability when that issue\nhas been tried separately by the court, or when, in a jury trial, the issue of\nliability has been tried before a jury and the issue of damages is to be tried\nbefore a different jury.\n\n* * *\n\n~~B.(1) When a court renders a partial judgment or partial summary judgment or\nsustains an exception in part, as to one or more but less than all of the\nclaims, demands, issues, or theories against a party, whether in an original\ndemand, reconventional demand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or\nintervention, the judgment shall not constitute a final judgment unless it is\ndesignated as a final judgment by the court after an express determination\nthat there is no just reason for delay.~~\n\n~~(2) In the absence of such a determination and designation, any such order\nor decision shall not constitute a final judgment for the purpose of an\nimmediate appeal and may be revised at any time prior to rendition of the\njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the\nparties.~~\n\n~~C.~~ _B._ If an appeal is taken from any judgment rendered ~~under the\nprovisions of~~ _in accordance with Paragraph A_ this Article, the trial court\nshall retain jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining issues in the case.\n\n_C. Except as otherwise provided by law, when a court grants a judgment or\nsummary judgment, or sustains an exception in part, as to one or more but\nfewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or theories by or against a\nparty, whether in an original demand, reconventional demand, cross-claim,\nthird-party claim, or intervention, that judgment is an interlocutory\njudgment._\n\n_D. All judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to\nwriting and signed by the court._\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) These amendments largely restore the Article to its pre-1997 form. The\nrevisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial\ncourt to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A\nof this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be\ntaken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a\nsupervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the\nsuccessful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate\nall of the issues in the case.\n\n(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former\nParagraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides\nfor interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).\nParagraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance\nwith this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus\nclearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ\nfrom a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C. See La. Ct. App.\nUnif. Rules 4-2 and 4-3 and Article 1914.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1974. Delay for applying for new trial\n\nA party may file a motion for a new trial not later than seven days, exclusive\nof legal holidays, after the clerk has mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or\nthe sheriff has served _,_ the notice of judgment as required by Article 1913.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2088. Divesting of jurisdiction of trial court\n\nA. The jurisdiction of the trial court over all matters in the case reviewable\nunder the appeal is divested, and that of the appellate court attaches, on the\ngranting of the order of appeal and the timely filing of the appeal bond, in\nthe case of a suspensive appeal, or on the granting of the order of appeal _,_\nin the case of a devolutive appeal. Thereafter, the trial court has\njurisdiction in the case only over those matters not reviewable under the\nappeal, including the right to do any of the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(11) ~~Certify a partial judgment or partial summary judgment in accordance\nwith Article 1915(B).~~\n\n~~(12)~~ Amend a judgment to provide proper decretal language ~~under~~ _in\naccordance with_ Article 1918 or 1951.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2595. Trial; decision\n\n_A._ Upon reasonable notice a summary proceeding ~~may be tried in open court\nor in chambers, in term or in vacation; and~~ shall be tried by preference\nover ordinary proceedings, and without a jury, except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.\n\n_B._ The court shall render its decision as soon as practicable after the\nconclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and, whenever practicable,\nwithout taking the matter under advisement.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4607. Partition by licitation or by private sale\n\nWhen a partition is to be made by licitation, the sale shall be conducted at\npublic auction and after the advertisements required for judicial sales under\nexecution. When a partition is to be made at private sale without the consent\nof all co-owners, the sale shall be for not less than the appraised value of\nthe property, and documents required pursuant to a court order shall be\nexecuted on behalf of the absentee or nonconsenting co-owner by a court-\nappointed representative, who may be a co-owner, after the advertisements\nrequired for judicial sales under execution are made. All counsel of record,\nincluding ~~curators~~ _attorneys_ appointed to represent absentee defendants,\nand persons appearing in proper person shall be given notice of the sale date.\nAt any time prior to the sale, the parties may agree upon a nonjudicial\npartition.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4873. Transfer to district court; procedure; contest; effect\n\nA party entitled thereto under the provisions of Article 4872 may transfer the\naction to the district court in the following manner:\n\n(1) Within the delay allowed for answer in the trial court of the limited\njurisdiction, or within ten days after answer has been filed, ~~he~~ _the\nparty_ shall file a motion to transfer with the clerk of the court in which\nthe suit is pending. The motion shall include a declaration that the matter is\none to which _the_ defendant would have been entitled to _a_ trial by jury if\ncommenced in district court, and that _the_ defendant desires _a_ trial by\njury. If a party fails to file a motion to transfer within the delays required\nby this Subparagraph, the matter shall not be transferred.\n\n(2) _A plaintiff may oppose the transfer of the action to a district court\nonly if the plaintiff stipulates that the action does not exceed ten thousand\ndollars exclusive of interest and costs._\n\n~~(2)~~ _(3)_ If no opposition is filed within ten days after the filing of\nthe motion to transfer, the judge of the court in which the suit is pending\nshall order the transfer to the district court. If an opposition is timely\nfiled, it shall be tried summarily.\n\n~~(3)~~ _(4)(a)_ Where a transfer is ordered, the clerk of the court in which\nthe action was initially filed shall forward to the clerk of _the_ court to\nwhich the action is transferred a certified copy of the record in the initial\ncourt, including pleadings, minute entries, and all other proceedings.\n\n_(b)_ The clerk of the district court shall file the action as a new\nproceeding in that court, upon payment by the defendant of a filing fee as\nprovided by rule of the district court. All costs accruing thereafter,\nhowever, shall be advanced in the same manner as though the action\n~~initially~~ had _initially_ been commenced in the district court by the\noriginal plaintiff.\n\n~~(4)~~ _(5)_ When the matter is docketed by the clerk of the district court,\nthe proceeding shall continue in that court as though originally commenced\ntherein. In the event _that_ transfer is effected prior to answer, _the_\ndefendant shall file ~~his~~ _the_ answer in the district court within the\ndelays provided by Article 1001, commencing from the date _on which_ the\ntransferred proceeding is filed in that court.\n\n~~(5)~~ _(6)_ The disposition of a motion to transfer and any opposition\nthereto shall not be appealable~~,~~ but shall be reviewable through the\nexercise of its supervisory jurisdiction by the court of appeal having\nappellate jurisdiction over the case.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 5059. Computation of time\n\nA. In computing a period of time allowed or prescribed by law or by order of\ncourt, the date of the act, event, or default ~~after~~ _from_ which the\nperiod begins to run is not ~~to be~~ included. The last day of the period is\n~~to be~~ included, unless it is a legal holiday, in which event the period\nruns until the end of the next day ~~which~~ _that_ is not a legal holiday.\n\nB. _The \"next day\" as set forth in Paragraph A of this Article means the\nsubsequent calendar day that is not a legal holiday following a legal\nholiday._\n\n~~B.~~ _C._ A half-holiday is considered ~~as~~ a legal holiday. A legal\nholiday is ~~to be~~ included in the computation of a period of time allowed\nor prescribed, except when:\n\n(1) It is expressly excluded~~;~~ _._\n\n(2) It would otherwise be the last day of the period~~; or~~ _._\n\n(3) The period is less than seven days.\n\n~~C.~~ _D._(1) A legal holiday shall be excluded in the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by an agency in the executive\nbranch of state government.\n\n(2) Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph shall not apply to the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by the Department of Revenue,\nthe Department of Environmental Quality, or the Department of Insurance\nrelative to examination reports in R.S. 22:1983.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe revisions to this Article clarify existing law and conform to the\ncomputation of time set forth in Becnel v. Northrop Grumman Ship Systems,\nInc., 18 So. 3d 1269 (La. 2009) and Article 966(B)(4). Paragraph B of this\nArticle makes clear that if the last day in a period of time allowed or\nprescribed by law or court order falls on a legal holiday, the period runs\nuntil the subsequent, later-in-time calendar day that is not a legal holiday.\nFor example, if the legal deadline to file a pretrial motion is due sixty days\nprior to trial and that day is a Saturday, the motion is not due until the\nsubsequent Monday as long as that Monday is not a legal holiday.\n\nSection 4. Code of Civil Procedure Articles74.2(F), 2088(A)(12), and 3784 are\nhereby repealed in their entirety.\n\nSection 5. The provisions of Civil Code Article 3462 as amended by Section 1\nof this Act shall not apply to actions that have prescribed prior to the\neffective date of this Act.\n\nSection 6. The provisions of Article 1915 as amended by Section 3 of this Act\nshall have prospective application only and shall not apply to appeals and\nsupervisory writs filed prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\nDIGEST\n\nThe digest printed below was prepared by House Legislative Services.

The filing of an action in a court of competent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is improper.

Louisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of lack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in a criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not interdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim. Under the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal proceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a civil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person&#39;s limited interdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full interdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less restrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not deprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of limited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article 4551 and Civil Code Article 390.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">* * *</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Art. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A.

R.S. 14:73:13 defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean &quot;any audio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered, or digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the individual or replace an individual&#39;s likeness with another individual and depicted in the recording.&quot; Black&#39;s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean a &quot;false video, audio recording, or other medium that is generated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence, with the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.&quot;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory.

As a result, Paragraph A of this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be taken.

The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides for interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C). Paragraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus clearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ from a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C.

Civil Code Article 3462 is hereby amended and reenacted to read as\nfollows:\n\nArt. 3462. Interruption by filing of ~~suit~~ _action_ or by service of\nprocess\n\n~~Prescription~~ _Unless otherwise expressly provided by legislation,\nprescription_ is interrupted when the owner commences action against the\npossessor, or when the obligee commences action against the obligor, in a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction and venue. If action is commenced in an\nincompetent court, or in an improper venue, prescription is interrupted only\nas to a defendant served by process within the prescriptive period. _If an\naction is commenced in a competent court of improper venue, prescription is\nsuspended for a period of seven days as to a defendant not served by process\nwithin the prescriptive period._\n\nRevision Comments - 2025\n\nThis amendment changes the law. The filing of an action in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is\nimproper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still\nrequire an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and\nproper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604\n(professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606\n(professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer,\nsurveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability),\nand 5608 (action against home inspectors).\n\nSection 2. Code of Civil Procedure Article 863(F) is hereby amended and\nreenacted to read as follows:\n\nArt. 863. Signing of pleadings; effect\n\n* * *\n\nF. A sanction authorized in Paragraph D _of this Article_ shall not be imposed\nwith respect to an original petition ~~which~~ _that_ is filed within sixty\ndays of an applicable prescriptive date and then voluntarily dismissed _or\ntransferred to a court of proper venue_ within ninety days after its filing or\non the date of a hearing on the pleading, whichever is earlier.\n\n* * *\n\nSection 3.

An attorney shall exercise reasonable diligence to verify the authenticity\nof evidence before offering it to the court. If an attorney knew or should\nhave known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that evidence was\nfalse or artificially manipulated, the offering of that evidence without\ndisclosure of that fact shall be considered a violation of this Article._\n\n_D._ For a violation of any of the provisions of this ~~article~~ _Article_ ,\nthe attorney ~~at law subjects himself~~ _is subject_ to punishment for\ncontempt of court~~,~~ and ~~such~~ further disciplinary action as is\notherwise provided by law.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 684. ~~Mental incompetent; interdict~~ _Interdict_\n\nA. ~~A mental incompetent~~ _A person fully interdicted or a person whose\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the procedural capacity to sue_\ndoes not have the procedural capacity to sue.\n\nB.

App. 1\nCir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of\nlack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in\na criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not\ninterdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim.\nUnder the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal\nproceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a\ncivil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person's limited\ninterdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full\ninterdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less\nrestrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not\ndeprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article\n4551 and Civil Code Article 390.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception\n\nA. The objections that may be raised through the peremptory exception include\nbut are not limited to the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No cause of action _, including an objection of no cause of action in\npart, as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or\ntheories against a party, whether in an original demand, reconventional\ndemand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or intervention_.\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nSubparagraph (A)(5) of this Article was amended to clarify that a partial\njudgment sustaining an exception raising the objection of no cause of action\nmay be appropriate when two or more actions based on the same operative facts\nof a single transaction or occurrence are cumulated. This changes the result\nreached by the Louisiana Supreme Court in Everything on Wheels Subaru, Inc. v.\nSubaru South., Inc., 616 So. 2d 1234 (La. 1993).\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 966. Motion for summary judgment; procedure\n\n* * *\n\nB. Unless extended by the court and agreed to by all of the parties, a motion\nfor summary judgment shall be filed, opposed, or replied to in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) ~~Notwithstanding Article 1915(B)(2), the~~ _The_ court shall not\nreconsider or revise the granting of a motion for partial summary judgment on\nmotion of a party who failed to meet the deadlines imposed by this Paragraph,\nnor shall the court consider any documents filed after those deadlines.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1201. Citation; waiver; delay for service\n\n* * *\n\nC. Service of the citation shall be requested on all named defendants within\nninety days of commencement of the action. When a supplemental or amended\npetition is filed naming any additional defendant, service of citation shall\nbe requested within ninety days of its filing, and the additional defendant\nshall be served with the original petition and the supplemental or amended\npetition. The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph\nby any written waiver. The requirement provided by this Paragraph shall be\nexpressly waived by a defendant unless the defendant files, in accordance with\nthe provisions of Article 928, a declinatory exception of insufficiency of\nservice of process specifically alleging the failure to timely request service\nof citation or _a contradictory motion in accordance with Article 1672(C)_.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1313. Service by mail, delivery, or electronic means\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, every pleading subsequent to the\noriginal petition, and every pleading which under an express provision of law\nmay be served as provided in this Article, may be served either by the sheriff\nor by:\n\n* * *\n\n(4) Transmitting a copy by electronic means to counsel of record, or if there\nis no counsel of record, to the adverse party, at the number or addresses\nexpressly designated in a pleading or other writing for receipt of electronic\nservice. Service by electronic means is complete upon transmission but is not\neffective and shall not be certified if the serving party learns _that_ the\ntransmission did not reach the party to be served. _If electronic service\ncannot be effected in accordance with this Subparagraph, service may be\neffected in accordance with other provisions of this Paragraph._\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe amendment to Subparagraph (A)(4) of this Article clarifies that if service\ncannot be effected by electronic means, service may be effected in accordance\nwith the other provisions of Paragraph A. See Article 966(B)(1) and (2)\nproviding that a motion for summary judgment, all documents in support of the\nmotion, any opposition to the motion, and all documents in support of the\nopposition shall be filed and served in accordance with Subparagraph (A)(4) of\nthis Article.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1351.

Pretrial and scheduling conference; order\n\nA. In any civil action in a district court _,_ the court may _,_ in its\ndiscretion _,_ direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for\nconferences _that may be conducted in chambers, by telephone, or by video\nteleconference_ to consider any of the following:\n\n(1) ~~The simplification of the issues, including the elimination of frivolous\nclaims or defenses~~ _The setting of deadlines for the filing of a motion in\naccordance with Article 1425(F), motion for summary judgment, motion in\nlimine, and any other pretrial motion_.\n\n(2) _The setting of the trial and the deadline for the filing of any jury\nbond._\n\n_(3)_ The necessity or desirability of _, and the deadline for filing, any_\namendments to the pleadings.\n\n~~(3) What material facts and issues exist without substantial controversy,\nand what material facts and issues are actually and in good faith\ncontroverted.~~\n\n(4) ~~Proof, stipulations regarding the authenticity of documents, and advance\nrulings from the court on the admissibility of evidence.~~ _The simplification\nof the issues, including stipulations as to material facts, exhibits, and\nissues that are not disputed, and a determination of the facts, exhibits, and\nissues to be tried._\n\n(5) _The authenticity and admissibility of exhibits that a party intends to\nintroduce at trial, including a pretrial ruling on the admissibility of\nexhibits or the setting of a hearing date as to the admissibility of\nexhibits._\n\n_(a) If a party has reasonable suspicion that an opposing party 's exhibits\nare falsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall raise these concerns at the pretrial\nconference or at a pretrial hearing on the admissibility of the exhibits._\n\n_(b) If a party knows or has reason to know that its exhibits have been\nfalsified, including having been generated by artificial intelligence or\naltered by any means, the party shall disclose this fact in accordance with\nArticle 371._\n\n_(c) Subsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Subparagraph shall not apply to\ndemonstrative exhibits._\n\n~~(5)~~ (6) Limitations or restrictions on or regulation of the use of expert\ntestimony ~~under Louisiana~~ _pursuant to_ Code of Evidence Article 702.\n\n~~(6)~~ _(7)_ The control and scheduling of discovery including any issues\nrelating to disclosure or discovery of electronically stored information, and\nthe form or forms in which it should be produced.\n\n~~(7)~~ _(8)_ Any issues relating to claims of privilege or protection of\ntrial preparation material, and whether the court should include agreements\nbetween counsel relating to ~~such~~ _those_ issues in an order.\n\n~~(8)~~ _(9)_ The identification of witnesses, documents, and exhibits.\n\n~~(9) The presentation of testimony or other evidence by electronic devices.~~\n\n(10) _The setting of any trial, motion, or exception hearing by audiovisual\nmeans, or the presentation of any evidence or testimony by audiovisual means,\nin accordance with Article 195.1._\n\n_(11)_ ~~Such other~~ _Other_ matters ~~as~~ _that_ may aid in the disposition\nof the action.\n\nB.

If a party's attorney fails to obey a pretrial order, or to appear at the\npretrial and scheduling conference, or is substantially unprepared to\nparticipate in the conference or fails to participate in good faith, the\ncourt, on its own motion or on the motion of a party, after hearing, may make\n~~such~~ orders as are just, including orders provided in Article 1471 _(A)_\n(2), (3), and (4). In lieu of or in addition to any other sanction, the court\nmay require the party or the attorney representing the party or both to pay\nthe reasonable expenses incurred by noncompliance with this Paragraph,\nincluding attorney fees.\n\nD.

The\nArticle's use of \"artificial intelligence\" is broad and encompasses the\nsuspected use of \"deepfakes\". R.S. 14:73:13 defines \"deepfake\" to mean \"any\naudio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered,\nor digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable\nobserver to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the\nindividual or replace an individual's likeness with another individual and\ndepicted in the recording.\" Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines\n\"deepfake\" to mean a \"false video, audio recording, or other medium that is\ngenerated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence,\nwith the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.\"\n\n(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory. To resolve the many\nissues with respect to the timing of challenging an expert's qualifications or\nmethodologies, the court shall either provide for deadlines in a pretrial or\nscheduling order in accordance with Paragraph A of this Article or, upon being\nnotified by a party that it intends to use an expert in a summary judgment\nproceeding or at trial, issue an order in accordance with Paragraph C of this\nArticle. These deadlines aim to ensure that motions are filed, and hearing\ndates are set, in accordance with applicable law and in consideration of the\ncourt's calendar.\n\n(c) The requirements of this Article are not meant to supersede the\nrequirements of Article 1571\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1702. Default judgment\n\nA.\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No default judgment shall be rendered against a defendant when notice is\nrequired ~~under~~ _pursuant to_ Subparagraph (2) or (3) of this Paragraph\nunless ~~proof of~~ the required notice is ~~made in the manner provided by\nR.S. 13:3205.~~ _given in accordance with any of the following:_\n\n_(a) By mailing the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the\nplaintiff shall provide proof that the notice was enclosed in an envelope\nproperly addressed to the defendant or attorney, with sufficient postage\naffixed, and the date on which it was deposited in the United States mail, and\nthe plaintiff shall file the return receipt of the defendant or attorney._\n\n_(b) By utilizing the services of a commercial courier to make delivery of the\nnotice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the plaintiff shall provide\nproof of the name of the commercial courier, the date, and the address at\nwhich the notice was delivered to the defendant or attorney, and the plaintiff\nshall file the commercial courier 's confirmation of delivery._\n\n_(c) By actual delivery of the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which\ncase the plaintiff shall provide proof of the date, place, and manner of\ndelivery._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1811.

A final judgment may be rendered ~~and signed by the court~~ , even though\nit may not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for,\nor may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case, when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to ~~less~~ _fewer_ than all of the parties,\ndefendants, ~~third party~~ _third-party_ plaintiffs, ~~third party~~ _third-\nparty_ defendants, or ~~intervenors~~ _interveners_.\n\n* * *\n\n(4) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on either the principal or incidental\ndemand, when the two have been tried separately, as provided by Article 1038.\n\n(5) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on the issue of liability when that issue\nhas been tried separately by the court, or when, in a jury trial, the issue of\nliability has been tried before a jury and the issue of damages is to be tried\nbefore a different jury.\n\n* * *\n\n~~B.(1) When a court renders a partial judgment or partial summary judgment or\nsustains an exception in part, as to one or more but less than all of the\nclaims, demands, issues, or theories against a party, whether in an original\ndemand, reconventional demand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or\nintervention, the judgment shall not constitute a final judgment unless it is\ndesignated as a final judgment by the court after an express determination\nthat there is no just reason for delay.~~\n\n~~(2) In the absence of such a determination and designation, any such order\nor decision shall not constitute a final judgment for the purpose of an\nimmediate appeal and may be revised at any time prior to rendition of the\njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the\nparties.~~\n\n~~C.~~ _B._ If an appeal is taken from any judgment rendered ~~under the\nprovisions of~~ _in accordance with Paragraph A_ this Article, the trial court\nshall retain jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining issues in the case.\n\n_C.

All judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to\nwriting and signed by the court._\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) These amendments largely restore the Article to its pre-1997 form. The\nrevisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial\ncourt to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A\nof this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be\ntaken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a\nsupervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the\nsuccessful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate\nall of the issues in the case.\n\n(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former\nParagraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides\nfor interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).\nParagraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance\nwith this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus\nclearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ\nfrom a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C. See La. Ct. App.\nUnif. Rules 4-2 and 4-3 and Article 1914.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1974. Delay for applying for new trial\n\nA party may file a motion for a new trial not later than seven days, exclusive\nof legal holidays, after the clerk has mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or\nthe sheriff has served _,_ the notice of judgment as required by Article 1913.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2088. Divesting of jurisdiction of trial court\n\nA. The jurisdiction of the trial court over all matters in the case reviewable\nunder the appeal is divested, and that of the appellate court attaches, on the\ngranting of the order of appeal and the timely filing of the appeal bond, in\nthe case of a suspensive appeal _,_ or on the granting of the order of appeal,\nin the case of a devolutive appeal. Thereafter, the trial court has\njurisdiction in the case only over those matters not reviewable under the\nappeal, including the right to do any of the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(11) ~~Certify a partial judgment or partial summary judgment in accordance\nwith Article 1915(B).~~\n\n~~(12)~~ Amend a judgment to provide proper decretal language ~~under~~ _in\naccordance with_ Article 1918 or 1951.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2595. Trial; decision\n\n_A._ Upon reasonable notice a summary proceeding ~~may be tried in open court\nor in chambers, in term or in vacation; and~~ shall be tried by preference\nover ordinary proceedings, and without a jury, except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.\n\n_B._ The court shall render its decision as soon as practicable after the\nconclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and, whenever practicable,\nwithout taking the matter under advisement.\n\n* * *\n\n_Art. 3721. Methods of enforcing mortgage_\n\n_A._ A conventional mortgage is enforced by ordinary or executory proceedings.\n\n_B. In any ordinary or executory proceeding to enforce a promissory note or\nother debt instrument combined with a mortgage or other security device, the\njudgment or order of executory process granted may include any amounts which\naccrue after the rendition of the judgment or order, including until the\ncollateral is sold by judicial process pursuant to the provisions of the\npromissory note, debt interest, or security device, including, without\nlimitation, obligations to reimburse advances for taxes and insurance,\ninspection or other fees provided for by contract, reasonable attorney fees,\nand court costs. The provisions of this Article shall be enforceable\nnotwithstanding any other provision of law requiring that a judgment or order\nspecify a definite amount._\n\n_C. Prior to the date of the sheriff 's sale, the seizing creditor or his\ncounsel shall file into the record the payoff amount of the obligation being\nenforced, including any amounts which have accrued after the filing of the\npetition, or rendition of the judgment or order in the case of ordinary\nprocess._\n\n_D. Any party with an interest in the property seized, including but not\nlimited to mortgage and lien holders, may file a rule to show cause to\ntraverse the payoff amount filed in accordance with Subsection C of this\nArticle. The rule to show cause shall be filed before the sheriff disburses\nany funds from the judicial sale pursuant to the writ being executed._\n\n_E. A sheriff 's or other sale held pursuant to court order shall be valid\nnotwithstanding failure of an interested party to comply with the provisions\nof this Article._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4607. Partition by licitation or by private sale\n\nWhen a partition is to be made by licitation, the sale shall be conducted at\npublic auction and after the advertisements required for judicial sales under\nexecution. When a partition is to be made at private sale without the consent\nof all co-owners, the sale shall be for not less than the appraised value of\nthe property, and documents required pursuant to a court order shall be\nexecuted on behalf of the absentee or nonconsenting co-owner by a court-\nappointed representative, who may be a co-owner, after the advertisements\nrequired for judicial sales under execution are made. All counsel of record,\nincluding ~~curators~~ _attorneys_ appointed to represent absentee defendants,\nand persons appearing in proper person shall be given notice of the sale date.\nAt any time prior to the sale, the parties may agree upon a nonjudicial\npartition.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4873. Transfer to district court; procedure; contest; effect\n\nA party entitled thereto under the provisions of Article 4872 may transfer the\naction to the district court in the following manner:\n\n(1) Within the delay allowed for answer in the trial court of the limited\njurisdiction, or within ten days after answer has been filed, ~~he~~ _the\nparty_ shall file a motion to transfer with the clerk of the court in which\nthe suit is pending. The motion shall include a declaration that the matter is\none to which _the_ defendant would have been entitled to _a_ trial by jury if\ncommenced in district court, and that _the_ defendant desires _a_ trial by\njury. If a party fails to file a motion to transfer within the delays required\nby this Subparagraph, the matter shall not be transferred.\n\n(2) _A plaintiff may oppose the transfer of the action to a district court\nonly if the plaintiff stipulates that the action does not exceed ten thousand\ndollars exclusive of interest and costs._\n\n~~(2)~~ _(3)_ If no opposition is filed within ten days after the filing of\nthe motion to transfer, the judge of the court in which the suit is pending\nshall order the transfer to the district court. If an opposition is timely\nfiled, it shall be tried summarily.\n\n~~(3)~~ _(4)(a)_ Where a transfer is ordered, the clerk of the court in which\nthe action was initially filed shall forward to the clerk of _the_ court to\nwhich the action is transferred a certified copy of the record in the initial\ncourt, including pleadings, minute entries, and all other proceedings.\n\n_(b)_ The clerk of the district court shall file the action as a new\nproceeding in that court, upon payment by the defendant of a filing fee as\nprovided by rule of the district court. All costs accruing thereafter,\nhowever, shall be advanced in the same manner as though the action\n~~initially~~ had _initially_ been commenced in the district court by the\noriginal plaintiff.\n\n~~(4)~~ _(5)_ When the matter is docketed by the clerk of the district court,\nthe proceeding shall continue in that court as though originally commenced\ntherein. In the event _that_ transfer is effected prior to answer, _the_\ndefendant shall file ~~his~~ _the_ answer in the district court within the\ndelays provided by Article 1001, commencing from the date _on which_ the\ntransferred proceeding is filed in that court.\n\n~~(5)~~ _(6)_ The disposition of a motion to transfer and any opposition\nthereto shall not be appealable~~,~~ but shall be reviewable through the\nexercise of its supervisory jurisdiction by the court of appeal having\nappellate jurisdiction over the case.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 5059. Computation of time\n\nA. In computing a period of time allowed or prescribed by law or by order of\ncourt, the date of the act, event, or default ~~after~~ _from_ which the\nperiod begins to run is not ~~to be~~ included. The last day of the period is\n~~to be~~ included, unless it is a legal holiday, in which event the period\nruns until the end of the next day ~~which~~ _that_ is not a legal holiday.\n\nB. _The \"next day\" as set forth in Paragraph A of this Article means the\nsubsequent calendar day that is not a legal holiday following a legal\nholiday._\n\n~~B.~~ _C._ A half-holiday is considered ~~as~~ a legal holiday. A legal\nholiday is ~~to be~~ included in the computation of a period of time allowed\nor prescribed, except when:\n\n(1) It is expressly excluded~~;~~ _._\n\n(2) It would otherwise be the last day of the period~~; or~~ _._\n\n(3) The period is less than seven days.\n\n~~C.~~ _D._(1) A legal holiday shall be excluded in the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by an agency in the executive\nbranch of state government.\n\n(2) Subparagraph (1) of this Paragraph shall not apply to the computation of a\nperiod of time allowed or prescribed to seek rehearing, reconsideration, or\njudicial review or appeal of a decision or order by the Department of Revenue,\nthe Department of Environmental Quality, or the Department of Insurance\nrelative to examination reports in R.S. 22:1983.\n\nComments - 2025\n\nThe revisions to this Article clarify existing law and conform to the\ncomputation of time set forth in Becnel v. Northrop Grumman Ship Systems,\nInc., 18 So. 3d 1269 (La. 2009) and Article 966(B)(4). Paragraph B of this\nArticle makes clear that if the last day in a period of time allowed or\nprescribed by law or court order falls on a legal holiday, the period runs\nuntil the subsequent, later-in-time calendar day that is not a legal holiday.\nFor example, if the legal deadline to file a pretrial motion is due sixty days\nprior to trial and that day is a Saturday, the motion is not due until the\nsubsequent Monday as long as that Monday is not a legal holiday.\n\nSection 4. Code of Civil Procedure Articles74.2(F), 2088(A)(12), and 3784 are\nhereby repealed in their entirety.\n\nSection 5. The provisions of Civil Code Article 3462 as amended by Section 1\nof this Act shall not apply to actions that have prescribed prior to the\neffective date of this Act.\n\nSection 6. The provisions of Article 1915 as amended by Section 3 of this Act\nshall have prospective application only and shall not apply to appeals and\nsupervisory writs filed prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

Louisiana Department of Health and Valley Services, 341 So. 3d 696 (La. App. 1 Cir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of lack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in a criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not interdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim. Under the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal proceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a civil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person&#39;s limited interdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full interdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less restrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389.

R.S. 14:73:13 defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean &quot;any audio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered, or digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable observer to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the individual or replace an individual&#39;s likeness with another individual and depicted in the recording.&quot; Black&#39;s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines &quot;deepfake&quot; to mean a &quot;false video, audio recording, or other medium that is generated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence, with the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.&quot;</p>\n     <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory.

The revisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial court to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A of this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be taken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a supervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case.</p>\n     <p class=\"indent\">(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former Paragraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides for interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C). Paragraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus clearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ from a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C.

Interruption by filing of ~~suit~~ _action_ or by service of\nprocess\n\n~~Prescription~~ _Unless otherwise expressly provided by legislation,\nprescription_ is interrupted when the owner commences action against the\npossessor, or when the obligee commences action against the obligor, in a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction and venue. If action is commenced in an\nincompetent court, or in an improper venue, prescription is interrupted only\nas to a defendant served by process within the prescriptive period. _If an\naction is commenced in a competent court of improper venue, prescription is\nsuspended for a period of seven days as to a defendant not served by process\nwithin the prescriptive period._\n\nRevision Comments - 2025\n\nThis amendment changes the law. The filing of an action in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction will interrupt the prescriptive period even if venue is\nimproper. There are, however, numerous more specific statutes that still\nrequire an action to be filed in a court of both competent jurisdiction and\nproper venue in order to interrupt prescription, including R.S. 9:5604\n(professional accounting liability), 5605 (legal malpractice), 5606\n(professional insurance agent liability), 5607 (professional engineer,\nsurveyor, interior designer, architect, and real estate developer liability),\nand 5608 (action against home inspectors).\n\nSection 2.

App. 1\nCir. 2022), in which the First Circuit held that sustaining an exception of\nlack of procedural capacity in a civil proceeding against a plaintiff who, in\na criminal proceeding, was determined a mental incompetent but was not\ninterdicted would leave the plaintiff with no avenue to pursue a civil claim.\nUnder the amendment to this Article, a person determined in a criminal\nproceeding to be a mental incompetent has the procedural capacity to file a\ncivil action unless that person is fully interdicted or the person's limited\ninterdiction restricts the capacity to sue. A court may order the full\ninterdiction of a person whose interests cannot be protected by less\nrestrictive means. See Civil Code Article 389. A limited interdiction does not\ndeprive the interdict of the procedural capacity to sue unless the judgment of\nlimited interdiction specifically restricts the ability to sue. See Article\n4551 and Civil Code Article 390.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 927. Objections raised by peremptory exception\n\nA. The objections that may be raised through the peremptory exception include\nbut are not limited to the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No cause of action _, including an objection of no cause of action in\npart, as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or\ntheories against a party, whether in an original demand, reconventional\ndemand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or intervention_.\n\n* * *\n\nComments - 2025\n\nSubparagraph (A)(5) of this Article was amended to clarify that a partial\njudgment sustaining an exception raising the objection of no cause of action\nmay be appropriate when two or more actions based on the same operative facts\nof a single transaction or occurrence are cumulated.

When a supplemental or amended\npetition is filed naming any additional defendant, service of citation shall\nbe requested within ninety days of its filing, and the additional defendant\nshall be served with the original petition and the supplemental or amended\npetition. The defendant may expressly waive the requirements of this Paragraph\nby any written waiver. The requirement provided by this Paragraph shall be\nexpressly waived by a defendant unless the defendant files, in accordance with\nthe provisions of Article 928, a declinatory exception of insufficiency of\nservice of process specifically alleging the failure to timely request service\nof citation or _a contradictory motion in accordance with Article 1672(C)_.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1313.

The\nArticle's use of \"artificial intelligence\" is broad and encompasses the\nsuspected use of \"deepfakes\". R.S. 14:73:13 defines \"deepfake\" to mean \"any\naudio or visual media in an electronic format . . . that is created, altered,\nor digitally manipulated in a manner that would falsely appear to a reasonable\nobserver to be an authentic record of the actual speech or conduct of the\nindividual or replace an individual's likeness with another individual and\ndepicted in the recording.\" Black's Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024) defines\n\"deepfake\" to mean a \"false video, audio recording, or other medium that is\ngenerated or manipulated by computer, often using artificial intelligence,\nwith the intent to deceive viewers or listeners.\"\n\n(b) Paragraph C of this Article is new and mandatory. To resolve the many\nissues with respect to the timing of challenging an expert's qualifications or\nmethodologies, the court shall either provide for deadlines in a pretrial or\nscheduling order in accordance with Paragraph A of this Article or, upon being\nnotified by a party that it intends to use an expert in a summary judgment\nproceeding or at trial, issue an order in accordance with Paragraph C of this\nArticle. These deadlines aim to ensure that motions are filed, and hearing\ndates are set, in accordance with applicable law and in consideration of the\ncourt's calendar.\n\n(c) The requirements of this Article are not meant to supersede the\nrequirements of Article 1571\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1702. Default judgment\n\nA.\n\n* * *\n\n(5) No default judgment shall be rendered against a defendant when notice is\nrequired ~~under~~ _pursuant to_ Subparagraph (2) or (3) of this Paragraph\nunless ~~proof of~~ the required notice is ~~made in the manner provided by\nR.S. 13:3205.~~ _given in accordance with any of the following:_\n\n_(a) By mailing the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the\nplaintiff shall provide proof that the notice was enclosed in an envelope\nproperly addressed to the defendant or attorney, with sufficient postage\naffixed, and the date on which it was deposited in the United States mail, and\nthe plaintiff shall file the return receipt of the defendant or attorney._\n\n_(b) By utilizing the services of a commercial courier to make delivery of the\nnotice to the defendant or attorney, in which case the plaintiff shall provide\nproof of the name of the commercial courier, the date, and the address at\nwhich the notice was delivered to the defendant or attorney, and the plaintiff\nshall file the commercial courier 's confirmation of delivery._\n\n_(c) By actual delivery of the notice to the defendant or attorney, in which\ncase the plaintiff shall provide proof of the date, place, and manner of\ndelivery._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1811.

If a verdict was not\nreturned, a party may move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict not\nlater than seven days, exclusive of legal holidays, after the jury was\ndischarged.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1911. Final judgment; ~~partial final judgment;~~ signing; appeals\n\n* * *\n\nB. For the purpose of an appeal as provided in Article 2083, no appeal ~~may~~\n_shall_ be taken from a final judgment until the ~~requirement of this Article\nhas been fulfilled~~ _judgment has been signed by the judge_. ~~No appeal may\nbe taken from a partial final judgment under Article 1915(B) until the\njudgment has been designated a final judgment under Article 1915(B). An appeal\nmay be taken from a final judgment under Article 1915(A) without the judgment\nbeing so designated.~~\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1913. Notice of judgment\n\nA. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of the signing of a final\njudgment~~, including a partial final judgment under Article 1915,~~ is\nrequired in all contested cases, and shall be mailed _or delivered in open\ncourt_ by the clerk of court to the counsel of record for each party, and to\neach party not represented by counsel. _Delivery of the signed judgment in\nopen court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be documented in the\nrecord of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nC. Except when service is required ~~under~~ _in accordance with_ Paragraph B\nof this Article, notice of the signing of a default judgment shall be mailed\nby the clerk of court to the defendant at the address where personal service\nwas obtained or to the last known address of the defendant.\n\nD.

Interlocutory judgments; notice; delay for further action\n\n* * *\n\nB. The interlocutory judgment shall be reduced to writing if the court so\norders, if a party requests within ten days of rendition in open court that it\nbe reduced to writing, _if a judgment is granted or an exception is sustained\nin accordance with Article 1915(C),_ or if the court takes the interlocutory\nmatter under advisement. The clerk shall mail _or deliver in open court_\nnotice of the ~~subsequent~~ judgment to each party. _Delivery of the signed\njudgment in open court shall constitute notice of judgment and shall be\ndocumented in the record of the proceeding._\n\n* * *\n\nD. Except as provided in Paragraph C of this Article, each party shall have\nten days either from notice of the interlocutory judgment, or from the mailing\nof notice when required to take any action or file any pleadings in the trial\ncourt~~; however, this~~ _. This_ provision does not suspend or otherwise\naffect the time for applying for supervisory writs, nor does it affect the\ntime for appealing an interlocutory judgment ~~under~~ _in accordance with_\nArticle 2083.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1915. ~~Partial final judgment~~ _Final and interlocutory judgments_ ;\npartial judgment; partial exception; partial summary judgment\n\nA. A final judgment may be rendered ~~and signed by the court~~ , even though\nit may not grant the successful party or parties all of the relief prayed for,\nor may not adjudicate all of the issues in the case, when the court:\n\n(1) Dismisses the suit as to ~~less~~ _fewer_ than all of the parties,\ndefendants, ~~third party~~ _third-party_ plaintiffs, ~~third party~~ _third-\nparty_ defendants, or ~~intervenors~~ _interveners_.\n\n* * *\n\n(4) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on either the principal or incidental\ndemand, when the two have been tried separately, as provided by Article 1038.\n\n(5) ~~Signs~~ _Grants_ a judgment on the issue of liability when that issue\nhas been tried separately by the court, or when, in a jury trial, the issue of\nliability has been tried before a jury and the issue of damages is to be tried\nbefore a different jury.\n\n* * *\n\n~~B.(1) When a court renders a partial judgment or partial summary judgment or\nsustains an exception in part, as to one or more but less than all of the\nclaims, demands, issues, or theories against a party, whether in an original\ndemand, reconventional demand, cross-claim, third-party claim, or\nintervention, the judgment shall not constitute a final judgment unless it is\ndesignated as a final judgment by the court after an express determination\nthat there is no just reason for delay.~~\n\n~~(2) In the absence of such a determination and designation, any such order\nor decision shall not constitute a final judgment for the purpose of an\nimmediate appeal and may be revised at any time prior to rendition of the\njudgment adjudicating all the claims and the rights and liabilities of all the\nparties.~~\n\n~~C.~~ _B._ If an appeal is taken from any judgment rendered ~~under the\nprovisions of~~ _in accordance with Paragraph A_ this Article, the trial court\nshall retain jurisdiction to adjudicate the remaining issues in the case.\n\n_C. Except as otherwise provided by law, when a court grants a judgment or\nsummary judgment, or sustains an exception in part, as to one or more but\nfewer than all of the claims, demands, issues, or theories by or against a\nparty, whether in an original demand, reconventional demand, cross-claim,\nthird-party claim, or intervention, that judgment is an interlocutory\njudgment._\n\n_D. All judgments rendered in accordance with this Article shall be reduced to\nwriting and signed by the court._\n\nComments - 2025\n\n(a) These amendments largely restore the Article to its pre-1997 form. The\nrevisions remove from Paragraph B of this Article the authority of the trial\ncourt to designate a judgment as final and appealable after an express\ndetermination that there is no just reason for delay. As a result, Paragraph A\nof this Article now provides a list of judgments from which an appeal may be\ntaken. This change seeks to remove uncertainty as to whether an appeal or a\nsupervisory writ should be taken from a judgment that does not grant the\nsuccessful party or parties all of the relief prayed for or may not adjudicate\nall of the issues in the case.\n\n(b) Paragraph B of this Article retains much of the language of former\nParagraph C. The language of Paragraph C of this Article is new and provides\nfor interlocutory judgments that are not appealable. See Article 2083(C).\nParagraph D of this Article provides that all judgments rendered in accordance\nwith this Article shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court, thus\nclearly defining the commencement of the delay to apply for a supervisory writ\nfrom a judgment rendered in accordance with Paragraph C. See La. Ct. App.\nUnif. Rules 4-2 and 4-3 and Article 1914.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 1974. Delay for applying for new trial\n\nA party may file a motion for a new trial not later than seven days, exclusive\nof legal holidays, after the clerk has mailed _or delivered in open court,_ or\nthe sheriff has served _,_ the notice of judgment as required by Article 1913.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2088. Divesting of jurisdiction of trial court\n\nA. The jurisdiction of the trial court over all matters in the case reviewable\nunder the appeal is divested, and that of the appellate court attaches, on the\ngranting of the order of appeal and the timely filing of the appeal bond, in\nthe case of a suspensive appeal _,_ or on the granting of the order of appeal,\nin the case of a devolutive appeal. Thereafter, the trial court has\njurisdiction in the case only over those matters not reviewable under the\nappeal, including the right to do any of the following:\n\n* * *\n\n(11) ~~Certify a partial judgment or partial summary judgment in accordance\nwith Article 1915(B).~~\n\n~~(12)~~ Amend a judgment to provide proper decretal language ~~under~~ _in\naccordance with_ Article 1918 or 1951.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 2595. Trial; decision\n\n_A._ Upon reasonable notice a summary proceeding ~~may be tried in open court\nor in chambers, in term or in vacation; and~~ shall be tried by preference\nover ordinary proceedings, and without a jury, except as otherwise provided by\nlaw.\n\n_B._ The court shall render its decision as soon as practicable after the\nconclusion of the trial of a summary proceeding and, whenever practicable,\nwithout taking the matter under advisement.\n\n* * *\n\n_Art. 3721. Methods of enforcing mortgage_\n\n_A._ A conventional mortgage is enforced by ordinary or executory proceedings.\n\n_B. In any ordinary or executory proceeding to enforce a promissory note or\nother debt instrument combined with a mortgage or other security device, the\njudgment or order of executory process granted may include any amounts which\naccrue after the rendition of the judgment or order, including until the\ncollateral is sold by judicial process pursuant to the provisions of the\npromissory note, debt interest, or security device, including, without\nlimitation, obligations to reimburse advances for taxes and insurance,\ninspection or other fees provided for by contract, reasonable attorney fees,\nand court costs. The provisions of this Article shall be enforceable\nnotwithstanding any other provision of law requiring that a judgment or order\nspecify a definite amount._\n\n_C. Prior to the date of the sheriff 's sale, the seizing creditor or his\ncounsel shall file into the record the payoff amount of the obligation being\nenforced, including any amounts which have accrued after the filing of the\npetition, or rendition of the judgment or order in the case of ordinary\nprocess._\n\n_D. Any party with an interest in the property seized, including but not\nlimited to mortgage and lien holders, may file a rule to show cause to\ntraverse the payoff amount filed in accordance with Subsection C of this\nArticle. The rule to show cause shall be filed before the sheriff disburses\nany funds from the judicial sale pursuant to the writ being executed._\n\n_E. A sheriff 's or other sale held pursuant to court order shall be valid\nnotwithstanding failure of an interested party to comply with the provisions\nof this Article._\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4607. Partition by licitation or by private sale\n\nWhen a partition is to be made by licitation, the sale shall be conducted at\npublic auction and after the advertisements required for judicial sales under\nexecution. When a partition is to be made at private sale without the consent\nof all co-owners, the sale shall be for not less than the appraised value of\nthe property, and documents required pursuant to a court order shall be\nexecuted on behalf of the absentee or nonconsenting co-owner by a court-\nappointed representative, who may be a co-owner, after the advertisements\nrequired for judicial sales under execution are made. All counsel of record,\nincluding ~~curators~~ _attorneys_ appointed to represent absentee defendants,\nand persons appearing in proper person shall be given notice of the sale date.\nAt any time prior to the sale, the parties may agree upon a nonjudicial\npartition.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 4873. Transfer to district court; procedure; contest; effect\n\nA party entitled thereto under the provisions of Article 4872 may transfer the\naction to the district court in the following manner:\n\n(1) Within the delay allowed for answer in the trial court of the limited\njurisdiction, or within ten days after answer has been filed, ~~he~~ _the\nparty_ shall file a motion to transfer with the clerk of the court in which\nthe suit is pending. The motion shall include a declaration that the matter is\none to which _the_ defendant would have been entitled to _a_ trial by jury if\ncommenced in district court, and that _the_ defendant desires _a_ trial by\njury. If a party fails to file a motion to transfer within the delays required\nby this Subparagraph, the matter shall not be transferred.\n\n(2) _A plaintiff may oppose the transfer of the action to a district court\nonly if the plaintiff stipulates that the action does not exceed ten thousand\ndollars exclusive of interest and costs._\n\n~~(2)~~ _(3)_ If no opposition is filed within ten days after the filing of\nthe motion to transfer, the judge of the court in which the suit is pending\nshall order the transfer to the district court. If an opposition is timely\nfiled, it shall be tried summarily.\n\n~~(3)~~ _(4)(a)_ Where a transfer is ordered, the clerk of the court in which\nthe action was initially filed shall forward to the clerk of _the_ court to\nwhich the action is transferred a certified copy of the record in the initial\ncourt, including pleadings, minute entries, and all other proceedings.\n\n_(b)_ The clerk of the district court shall file the action as a new\nproceeding in that court, upon payment by the defendant of a filing fee as\nprovided by rule of the district court.

In the event _that_ transfer is effected prior to answer, _the_\ndefendant shall file ~~his~~ _the_ answer in the district court within the\ndelays provided by Article 1001, commencing from the date _on which_ the\ntransferred proceeding is filed in that court.\n\n~~(5)~~ _(6)_ The disposition of a motion to transfer and any opposition\nthereto shall not be appealable~~,~~ but shall be reviewable through the\nexercise of its supervisory jurisdiction by the court of appeal having\nappellate jurisdiction over the case.\n\n* * *\n\nArt. 5059. Computation of time\n\nA. In computing a period of time allowed or prescribed by law or by order of\ncourt, the date of the act, event, or default ~~after~~ _from_ which the\nperiod begins to run is not ~~to be~~ included. The last day of the period is\n~~to be~~ included, unless it is a legal holiday, in which event the period\nruns until the end of the next day ~~which~~ _that_ is not a legal holiday.\n\nB. _The \"next day\" as set forth in Paragraph A of this Article means the\nsubsequent calendar day that is not a legal holiday following a legal\nholiday._\n\n~~B.~~ _C._ A half-holiday is considered ~~as~~ a legal holiday.

Northrop Grumman Ship Systems,\nInc., 18 So. 3d 1269 (La. 2009) and Article 966(B)(4). Paragraph B of this\nArticle makes clear that if the last day in a period of time allowed or\nprescribed by law or court order falls on a legal holiday, the period runs\nuntil the subsequent, later-in-time calendar day that is not a legal holiday.\nFor example, if the legal deadline to file a pretrial motion is due sixty days\nprior to trial and that day is a Saturday, the motion is not due until the\nsubsequent Monday as long as that Monday is not a legal holiday.\n\nSection 4. Code of Civil Procedure Articles 74.2(F), 2088(A)(12), and 3784 are\nhereby repealed in their entirety.\n\nSection 5. The provisions of Civil Code Article 3462 as amended by Section 1\nof this Act shall not apply to actions that have prescribed prior to the\neffective date of this Act.\n\nSection 6. The provisions of Article 1915 as amended by Section 3 of this Act\nshall have prospective application only and shall not apply to appeals and\nsupervisory writs filed prior to the effective date of this Act.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
