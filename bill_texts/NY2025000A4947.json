Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the &quot;New York privacy act&quot;. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 2. Legislative intent. 1. Privacy is a fundamental right and an essential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced rampant growth in the amount and categories of personal data being generated, collected, stored, analyzed, and potentially shared, which presents both promise and peril. Companies collect, use and share our personal data in ways that can be difficult for ordinary consumers to understand. Opaque data processing policies make it impossible to evaluate risks and compare privacy-related protections across services, stifling competition. Algorithms quietly make decisions with critical consequences for New York consumers, often with no human accountability. Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning people into products and their activity into assets. New York consumers deserve more notice and more control over their data and their digital privacy. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy. It gives New York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their personal data and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and accountable managers of that information. To achieve this, this act provides New York consumers a number of new rights, including clear notice of how their data is being used, processed and shared; the ability to access and obtain a copy of their data in a commonly used electronic format, with the ability to transfer it between services; the ability to correct inaccurate data and to delete their data; and the ability to challenge certain automated decisions. This act also imposes obligations upon businesses to maintain reasonable data security for personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable harms arising from use of their data and to obtain specific consent for that use, and to conduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not being used for unacceptable purposes. These data assessments can be obtained and evaluated by the New York State Attorney General, who is empowered to obtain penalties for violations of this act and prevent future violations. This act also grants New York consumers who have been injured as the result of a violation a private right of action, which includes reasonable attorneys&#39; fees to a prevailing plaintiff. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42-A to read as follows: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">ARTICLE 42-A</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">NEW YORK PRIVACY ACT</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Section 1200.

(i) The notice must be written in easy-to-understand language at an eighth grade reading level or below.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) The categories of personal data processed and purposes for which each category of personal data is processed must be described at a level specific enough to enable a consumer to exercise meaningful control over their personal data but not so specific as to render the notice unhelpful to a reasonable consumer.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iii) The notice must be dated with its effective date and updated at least annually. When the information required to be disclosed to a consumer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subdivision has not changed since the immediately previous notice (whether initial, annual, or revised) provided to the consumer, a controller may issue a statement that no changes have been made.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iv) The notice, as well as each version of the notice in effect in the preceding six years, must be easily accessible to consumers and capable of being viewed by consumers at any time.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">2.

To the extent that the privacy control conflicts with a consumer&#39;s consent, the privacy control settings govern, unless the consumer provides freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent to override the privacy control.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(j) A controller must not discriminate against a consumer for withholding or denying consent, including, but not limited to, by:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) denying services or goods to the consumer, unless the consumer does not consent to processing necessary to provide the services or goods requested by the consumer;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) charging different prices for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits, imposing penalties, or providing a different level or quality of services or goods to the consumer; or</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iii) suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of services or goods.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(k) A controller may, with the consumer&#39;s freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent given pursuant to this section, operate a program in which information, products, or services sold to the consumer are discounted based solely on such consumer&#39;s prior purchases from the controller, provided that the personal data used to operate such program is processed solely for the purpose of operating such program.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(l) In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction in which another entity assumes control or ownership of all or majority of the controller&#39;s assets, any consent provided to the controller by a consumer prior to such transaction shall be deemed withdrawn.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3. Right to access. Upon the verified request of a consumer, a controller shall:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) confirm whether or not the controller is processing or has processed personal data of that consumer, and provide access to a copy of any such personal data in a manner understandable to a reasonable consumer when requested; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) provide the identity of each processor or third party to whom the controller disclosed, transferred, or sold the consumer&#39;s personal data and, for each identified processor or third party, (i) the categories of the consumer&#39;s personal data disclosed, transferred, or sold to each processor or third party and (ii) the purposes for which each category of the consumer&#39;s personal data was disclosed, transferred, or sold to each processor or third party.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">4.

Right to correct. (a) Upon the verified request of a consumer or their agent, a controller must conduct a reasonable investigation to determine whether personal data, the accuracy of which is disputed by the consumer, is inaccurate, with such investigation to be concluded within the time period set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision eight of this section.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subdivision, a controller may terminate an investigation initiated pursuant to such paragraph if the controller reasonably and in good faith determines that the dispute by the consumer is wholly without merit, including by reason of a failure by a consumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed personal data. Upon making any determination in accordance with this paragraph that a dispute is wholly without merit, a controller must, within the time period set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision eight of this section, provide the affected consumer a statement in writing that includes, at a minimum, the specific reasons for the determination, and identification of any information required to investigate the disputed personal data, which may consist of a standardized form describing the general nature of such information.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) If, after any investigation under paragraph (a) of this subdivision of any personal data disputed by a consumer, an item of the personal data is found to be inaccurate or incomplete, or cannot be verified, the controller must:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) correct the inaccurate or incomplete personal data of the consumer; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) unless it proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort, communicate such request to each processor or third party to whom the controller disclosed, transferred, or sold the personal data within one year preceding the consumer&#39;s request, and to require those processors or third parties to do the same for any further processors or third parties they disclosed, transferred, or sold the personal data to.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) If the investigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumer may file with the controller a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute. Whenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there exists reasonable grounds to believe that it is wholly without merit, the controller must note that it is disputed by the consumer and include either the consumer&#39;s statement or a clear and accurate codification or summary thereof with the disputed personal data whenever it is disclosed, transferred, or sold to any processor or third party.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">6.

(a) Upon the verified request of a consumer, a controller must:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) within forty-five days after receiving the verified request, delete any or all personal data, as directed by the consumer or their agent, that the controller possesses or controls; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) unless it proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort that is documented in writing by the controller, communicate such request to each processor or third party to whom the controller disclosed, transferred or sold the personal data within one year preceding the consumer&#39;s request and to require those processors or third parties to do the same for any further processors or third parties they disclosed, transferred, or sold the personal data to.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) For personal data that is not possessed by the controller but by a processor of the controller, the controller may choose to (i) communicate the consumer&#39;s request for deletion to the processor, or (ii) request that the processor return to the controller the personal data that is the subject of the consumer&#39;s request and delete such personal data upon receipt of the request.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) A consumer&#39;s deletion of their online account must be treated as a request to the controller to delete all of that consumer&#39;s personal data.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) A controller must maintain reasonable procedures designed to prevent the reappearance in its systems, and in any data it discloses, transfers, or sells to any processor or third party, the personal data that is deleted pursuant to this subdivision.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(e) A controller is not required to comply with a consumer&#39;s request to delete personal data if:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) complying with the request would prevent the controller from performing accounting functions, processing refunds, effectuating a product recall pursuant to federal or state law, or fulfilling warranty claims, provided that the personal data that is the subject of the request is not processed for any purpose other than such specific activities; or</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) it is necessary for the controller to maintain the consumer&#39;s personal data to engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the controller&#39;s deletion of the information is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of such research, provided that the consumer has given informed consent and the personal data is not processed for any purpose other than such research.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">7. Automated decision-making. (a) Whenever a controller makes an automated decision involving solely automated processing that materially contributes to a denial of financial or lending services, housing, public accommodation, insurance, health care services, or access to basic necessities, such as food and water, the controller must:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) disclose in a clear, conspicuous, and consumer-friendly manner that the decision was made by a solely automated process;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) provide an avenue for the affected consumer to appeal the decision, which must at minimum allow the affected consumer to (A) formally contest the decision, (B) provide information to support their position, and (C) obtain meaningful human review of the decision; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iii) explain the process to appeal the decision.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) A controller must respond to a consumer&#39;s appeal within forty-five days of receipt of the appeal.

That period may be extended once by forty-five additional days where reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller must inform the consumer of any such extension within forty-five days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. When a controller denies any such request, it must within this period disclose to the consumer a statement in writing of the specific reasons for the denial.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) A controller shall permit the exercise of rights and carry out its obligations set forth in subdivisions three through six of this section free of charge, at least twice annually to the consumer. Where requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either (i) charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or (ii) refuse to act on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) (i) A controller shall promptly attempt, using commercially reasonable efforts, to verify that all requests to exercise any rights set forth in any section of this article requiring a verified request were made by the consumer who is the subject of the data, or by a person lawfully exercising the right on behalf of the consumer who is the subject of the data. Commercially reasonable efforts shall be determined based on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature of the data implicated by the request.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) A controller may require the consumer to provide additional information only if the request cannot reasonably be verified without the provision of such additional information.

Non-waiver of rights. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way a consumer&#39;s rights under this article is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Section 1203. Controller, processor, and third party responsibilities. 1. Controller responsibilities. (a) Data protection assessment. A controller shall regularly conduct and document a data protection assessment for processing activities that present a heightened risk of harm to the consumer. Such assessment must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer, or class of consumers, associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that the controller can employ to reduce the risks. The controller shall factor into this assessment the use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, with the goal of restricting or prohibiting such processing if the risks of harm to the consumer outweigh the benefits resulting from the processing to the consumer. Processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to the consumer includes the following:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(i) processing that may benefit the controller to the detriment of the consumer;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(ii) processing that would be unexpected and highly offensive to a reasonable consumer;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iii) processing personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(iv) sale of personal data; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(v) processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(A) unfair or deceptive treatment, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers or a class of consumers;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(B) financial, physical, psychological or reputational injury to consumers, or a class of consumers;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(C) a physical or otherwise intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(D) other substantial injury to consumers.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Duty of loyalty.

ROSENTHAL, WEPRIN, SIMON, DINOWITZ, PAULIN -- read once\nand referred to the Committee on Consumer Affairs and Protection\n\nAN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the management and\noversight of personal data\n\n**The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do\nenact as follows:**\n\nSection 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may be cited as the \"New\nYork privacy act\".\n\nSection 2. Legislative intent. 1. Privacy is a fundamental right and an\nessential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced rampant\ngrowth in the amount and categories of personal data being generated,\ncollected, stored, analyzed, and potentially shared, which presents both\npromise and peril. Companies collect, use and share our personal data in ways\nthat can be difficult for ordinary consumers to understand. Opaque data\nprocessing policies make it impossible to evaluate risks and compare privacy-\nrelated protections across services, stifling competition. Algorithms quietly\nmake decisions with critical consequences for New York consumers, often with\nno human accountability. Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning\npeople into products and their activity into assets. New York consumers\ndeserve more notice and more control over their data and their digital\nprivacy.\n\n2\\. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy. It gives\nNew York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their personal\ndata and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and accountable\nmanagers of that information. To achieve this, this act provides New York\nconsumers a number of new rights, including clear notice of how their data is\nbeing used, processed and shared; the ability to access and obtain a copy of\ntheir data in a commonly used electronic format, with the ability to transfer\nit between services; the ability to correct inaccurate data and to delete\ntheir data; and the ability to challenge certain automated decisions. This act\nalso imposes obligations upon businesses to maintain reasonable data security\nfor personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable harms arising\nfrom use of their data and to obtain specific consent for that use, and to\nconduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not being used for\nunacceptable purposes. These data assessments can be obtained and evaluated by\nthe New York State Attorney General, who is empowered to obtain penalties for\nviolations of this act and prevent future violations. This act also grants New\nYork consumers who have been injured as the result of a violation a private\nright of action, which includes reasonable attorneys' fees to a prevailing\nplaintiff.\n\nSection 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42-A to\nread as follows:\n\n_ARTICLE 42-A_\n\n_NEW YORK PRIVACY ACT_\n\n_Section 1200. Definitions._\n\n_1201\\.

When the information required to be disclosed to a consumer pursuant\nto paragraph (a) of this subdivision has not changed since the immediately\nprevious notice (whether initial, annual, or revised) provided to the\nconsumer, a controller may issue a statement that no changes have been made._\n\n_(iv) The notice, as well as each version of the notice in effect in the\npreceding six years, must be easily accessible to consumers and capable of\nbeing viewed by consumers at any time._\n\n_2\\.

Such mechanism shall make it as easy for\na consumer to withdraw their consent as it is for such consumer to provide\nconsent._\n\n_(f) A controller must not infer that a consumer has provided freely given,\nspecific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent from the consumer 's\ninaction or the consumer's continued use of a service or product provided by\nthe controller._\n\n_(g) To the extent that a controller must process internet protocol addresses,\nsystem configuration information, URLs of referring pages, locale and language\npreferences, keystrokes, or any other data that individually or collectively\nmay comprise personal data in order to obtain a consumer 's freely given,\nspecific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent, the controller must:_\n\n_(i) process only the personal data necessary to request freely given,\nspecific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent;_\n\n_(ii) process the personal data solely to request freely given, specific,\ninformed, and unambiguous opt-in consent; and_\n\n_(iii) promptly delete the personal data if consent is withheld, denied, or\nwithdrawn._\n\n_(h) Controllers must not request consent from a consumer who has previously\nwithheld or denied consent, unless consent is necessary to provide the\nservices or goods requested by the consumer._\n\n_(i) Controllers must treat user-enabled privacy controls in a browser,\nbrowser plug-in, smartphone application, operating system, device setting, or\nother mechanism that communicates or signals the consumer 's choice not to be\nsubject to targeted advertising or the sale of their personal data as a denial\nof consent under this article. To the extent that the privacy control\nconflicts with a consumer's consent, the privacy control settings govern,\nunless the consumer provides freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous\nopt-in consent to override the privacy control._\n\n_(j) A controller must not discriminate against a consumer for withholding or\ndenying consent, including, but not limited to, by:_\n\n_(i) denying services or goods to the consumer, unless the consumer does not\nconsent to processing necessary to provide the services or goods requested by\nthe consumer;_\n\n_(ii) charging different prices for goods or services, including through the\nuse of discounts or other benefits, imposing penalties, or providing a\ndifferent level or quality of services or goods to the consumer; or_\n\n_(iii) suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for\ngoods or services or a different level or quality of services or goods._\n\n_(k) A controller may, with the consumer 's freely given, specific, informed,\nand unambiguous opt-in consent given pursuant to this section, operate a\nprogram in which information, products, or services sold to the consumer are\ndiscounted based solely on such consumer's prior purchases from the\ncontroller, provided that the personal data used to operate such program is\nprocessed solely for the purpose of operating such program._\n\n_(l) In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or other transaction\nin which another entity assumes control or ownership of all or majority of the\ncontroller 's assets, any consent provided to the controller by a consumer\nprior to such transaction shall be deemed withdrawn._\n\n_3\\. Right to access. Upon the verified request of a consumer, a controller\nshall:_\n\n_(a) confirm whether or not the controller is processing or has processed\npersonal data of that consumer, and provide access to a copy of any such\npersonal data in a manner understandable to a reasonable consumer when\nrequested; and_\n\n_(b) provide the identity of each processor or third party to whom the\ncontroller disclosed, transferred, or sold the consumer 's personal data and,\nfor each identified processor or third party, (i) the categories of the\nconsumer's personal data disclosed, transferred, or sold to each processor or\nthird party and (ii) the purposes for which each category of the consumer's\npersonal data was disclosed, transferred, or sold to each processor or third\nparty._\n\n_4\\. Right to portable data. Upon a verified request, and to the extent\ntechnically feasible, the controller must: (a) provide to the consumer a copy\nof all of, or a portion of, as designated in a verified request, the consumer\n's personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format\nand (b) transmit the data to another person of the consumer's or their agent's\ndesignation without hindrance._\n\n_5\\. Right to correct. (a) Upon the verified request of a consumer or their\nagent, a controller must conduct a reasonable investigation to determine\nwhether personal data, the accuracy of which is disputed by the consumer, is\ninaccurate, with such investigation to be concluded within the time period set\nforth in paragraph (a) of subdivision eight of this section._\n\n_(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subdivision, a controller may\nterminate an investigation initiated pursuant to such paragraph if the\ncontroller reasonably and in good faith determines that the dispute by the\nconsumer is wholly without merit, including by reason of a failure by a\nconsumer to provide sufficient information to investigate the disputed\npersonal data. Upon making any determination in accordance with this paragraph\nthat a dispute is wholly without merit, a controller must, within the time\nperiod set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision eight of this section,\nprovide the affected consumer a statement in writing that includes, at a\nminimum, the specific reasons for the determination, and identification of any\ninformation required to investigate the disputed personal data, which may\nconsist of a standardized form describing the general nature of such\ninformation._\n\n_(c) If, after any investigation under paragraph (a) of this subdivision of\nany personal data disputed by a consumer, an item of the personal data is\nfound to be inaccurate or incomplete, or cannot be verified, the controller\nmust:_\n\n_(i) correct the inaccurate or incomplete personal data of the consumer; and_\n\n_(ii) unless it proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort,\ncommunicate such request to each processor or third party to whom the\ncontroller disclosed, transferred, or sold the personal data within one year\npreceding the consumer 's request, and to require those processors or third\nparties to do the same for any further processors or third parties they\ndisclosed, transferred, or sold the personal data to._\n\n_(d) If the investigation does not resolve the dispute, the consumer may file\nwith the controller a brief statement setting forth the nature of the dispute.\nWhenever a statement of a dispute is filed, unless there exists reasonable\ngrounds to believe that it is wholly without merit, the controller must note\nthat it is disputed by the consumer and include either the consumer 's\nstatement or a clear and accurate codification or summary thereof with the\ndisputed personal data whenever it is disclosed, transferred, or sold to any\nprocessor or third party._\n\n_6\\. Right to delete. (a) Upon the verified request of a consumer, a\ncontroller must:_\n\n_(i) within forty-five days after receiving the verified request, delete any\nor all personal data, as directed by the consumer or their agent, that the\ncontroller possesses or controls; and_\n\n_(ii) unless it proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort that is\ndocumented in writing by the controller, communicate such request to each\nprocessor or third party to whom the controller disclosed, transferred or sold\nthe personal data within one year preceding the consumer 's request and to\nrequire those processors or third parties to do the same for any further\nprocessors or third parties they disclosed, transferred, or sold the personal\ndata to._\n\n_(b) For personal data that is not possessed by the controller but by a\nprocessor of the controller, the controller may choose to (i) communicate the\nconsumer 's request for deletion to the processor, or (ii) request that the\nprocessor return to the controller the personal data that is the subject of\nthe consumer's request and delete such personal data upon receipt of the\nrequest._\n\n_(c) A consumer 's deletion of their online account must be treated as a\nrequest to the controller to delete all of that consumer's personal data._\n\n_(d) A controller must maintain reasonable procedures designed to prevent the\nreappearance in its systems, and in any data it discloses, transfers, or sells\nto any processor or third party, the personal data that is deleted pursuant to\nthis subdivision._\n\n_(e) A controller is not required to comply with a consumer 's request to\ndelete personal data if:_\n\n_(i) complying with the request would prevent the controller from performing\naccounting functions, processing refunds, effectuating a product recall\npursuant to federal or state law, or fulfilling warranty claims, provided that\nthe personal data that is the subject of the request is not processed for any\npurpose other than such specific activities; or_\n\n_(ii) it is necessary for the controller to maintain the consumer 's personal\ndata to engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or\nstatistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other\napplicable ethics and privacy laws, when the controller's deletion of the\ninformation is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement\nof such research, provided that the consumer has given informed consent and\nthe personal data is not processed for any purpose other than such research._\n\n_7\\. Automated decision-making. (a) Whenever a controller makes an automated\ndecision involving solely automated processing that materially contributes to\na denial of financial or lending services, housing, public accommodation,\ninsurance, health care services, or access to basic necessities, such as food\nand water, the controller must:_\n\n_(i) disclose in a clear, conspicuous, and consumer-friendly manner that the\ndecision was made by a solely automated process;_\n\n_(ii) provide an avenue for the affected consumer to appeal the decision,\nwhich must at minimum allow the affected consumer to (A) formally contest the\ndecision, (B) provide information to support their position, and (C) obtain\nmeaningful human review of the decision; and_\n\n_(iii) explain the process to appeal the decision._\n\n_(b) A controller must respond to a consumer 's appeal within forty-five days\nof receipt of the appeal. That period may be extended once by forty-five\nadditional days where reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity\nand number of appeals. The controller must inform the consumer of any such\nextension within forty-five days of receipt of the appeal, together with the\nreasons for the delay._\n\n_(c) (i) A controller or processor engaged in automated decision-making\naffecting financial or lending services, housing, public accommodation,\ninsurance, education enrollment, employment, health care services, or access\nto basic necessities, such as food and water, or engaged in assisting others\nin automated decision-making in those fields, must annually conduct an impact\nassessment of such automated decision-making that:_\n\n_(A) describes and evaluates the objectives and development of the automated\ndecision-making processes including the design and training data used to\ndevelop the automated decision-making process, how the automated decision-\nmaking process was tested for accuracy, fairness, bias and discrimination;\nand_\n\n_(B) assesses whether the automated decision-making system produces\ndiscriminatory results on the basis of a consumer 's or class of consumers'\nactual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, religion, national origin, sex,\ngender, gender identity, sexual orientation, familial status, biometric\ninformation, lawful source of income, or disability._\n\n_(ii) A controller or processor must utilize an external, independent auditor\nor researcher to conduct such assessments._\n\n_(iii) A controller or processor must make publicly available in a manner\naccessible online all impact assessments prepared pursuant to this section,\nretain all such impact assessments for at least six years, and make any such\nretained impact assessments available to any state, federal, or local\ngovernment authority upon request._\n\n_(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the limitations to jurisdictional scope\nset forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of subdivision two of section twelve\nhundred one of this article shall not apply._\n\n_8\\. Responding to requests. (a) A controller must take action under\nsubdivisions three through six of this section and inform the consumer of any\nactions taken without undue delay and in any event within fortyfive days of\nreceipt of the request. That period may be extended once by forty-five\nadditional days where reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity\nand number of the requests. The controller must inform the consumer of any\nsuch extension within forty-five days of receipt of the request, together with\nthe reasons for the delay. When a controller denies any such request, it must\nwithin this period disclose to the consumer a statement in writing of the\nspecific reasons for the denial._\n\n_(b) A controller shall permit the exercise of rights and carry out its\nobligations set forth in subdivisions three through six of this section free\nof charge, at least twice annually to the consumer. Where requests from a\nconsumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their\nrepetitive character, the controller may either (i) charge a reasonable fee to\ncover the administrative costs of complying with the request or (ii) refuse to\nact on the request and notify the consumer of the reason for refusing the\nrequest. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly\nunfounded or excessive character of the request._\n\n_(c) (i) A controller shall promptly attempt, using commercially reasonable\nefforts, to verify that all requests to exercise any rights set forth in any\nsection of this article requiring a verified request were made by the consumer\nwho is the subject of the data, or by a person lawfully exercising the right\non behalf of the consumer who is the subject of the data. Commercially\nreasonable efforts shall be determined based on the totality of the\ncircumstances, including the nature of the data implicated by the request._\n\n_(ii) A controller may require the consumer to provide additional information\nonly if the request cannot reasonably be verified without the provision of\nsuch additional information. A controller must not transfer or process any\nsuch additional information provided pursuant to this section for any other\npurpose and must delete any such additional information without undue delay\nand in any event within forty-five days after the controller has notified the\nconsumer that it has taken action on a request under subdivisions two through\nfive of this section as described in paragraph (a) of this subdivision._\n\n_(iii) If a controller discloses this additional information to any processor\nor third party for the purpose of verifying a consumer request, it must notify\nthe receiving processor or third party at the time of such disclosure, or as\nclose in time to the disclosure as is reasonably practicable, that such\ninformation was provided by the consumer for the sole purpose of verification\nand cannot be processed for any purpose other than verification._\n\n_9\\. Implementation of rights. Controllers must provide easily accessible and\nconvenient means for consumers to exercise their rights under this article._\n\n_10\\. Non-waiver of rights. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any\nkind that purports to waive or limit in any way a consumer 's rights under\nthis article is contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable._\n\n_Section 1203. Controller, processor, and third party responsibilities. 1.\nController responsibilities. (a) Data protection assessment. A controller\nshall regularly conduct and document a data protection assessment for\nprocessing activities that present a heightened risk of harm to the consumer.\nSuch assessment must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly\nand indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other\nstakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the\nconsumer, or class of consumers, associated with the processing, as mitigated\nby safeguards that the controller can employ to reduce the risks. The\ncontroller shall factor into this assessment the use of deidentified data and\nthe reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the\nprocessing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose\npersonal data will be processed, with the goal of restricting or prohibiting\nsuch processing if the risks of harm to the consumer outweigh the benefits\nresulting from the processing to the consumer. Processing that presents a\nheightened risk of harm to the consumer includes the following:_\n\n_(i) processing that may benefit the controller to the detriment of the\nconsumer;_\n\n_(ii) processing that would be unexpected and highly offensive to a reasonable\nconsumer;_\n\n_(iii) processing personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;_\n\n_(iv) sale of personal data; and_\n\n_(v) processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such\nprofiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:_\n\n_(A) unfair or deceptive treatment, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers\nor a class of consumers;_\n\n_(B) financial, physical, psychological or reputational injury to consumers,\nor a class of consumers;_\n\n_(C) a physical or otherwise intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the\nprivate affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be\noffensive to a reasonable person; or_\n\n_(D) other substantial injury to consumers._\n\n_(b) Duty of loyalty. (i) A controller must notify the consumer, or class of\nconsumers, of the interest that may be harmed in advance of requesting consent\nand as close in time to the processing as practicable where it is reasonably\nforeseeable to the controller that a process presents a heightened risk of\nharm to the consumer or class of consumers._\n\n_(ii) Controllers must not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or\npractices with respect to obtaining consumer consent, the processing of\npersonal data, and a consumer 's exercise of any rights under this article,\nincluding without limitation:_\n\n_(A) designing a user interface with the purpose or substantial effect of\ndeceiving consumers, obscuring consumers ' rights under this article, or\nsubverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice in order to\nobtain consent; or_\n\n_(B) obtaining consent in a manner designed to overpower a consumer 's\nresistance; for example, by making excessive requests for consent._\n\n_(c) Duty of care. (i) (A) Controllers must, on at least an annual basis,\nconduct and document risk assessments of all current processing of personal\ndata._\n\n_(B) Risk assessments must assess at a minimum:_\n\n_(I) the nature, sensitivity and context of the personal data that the\ncontroller processes;_\n\n_(II) the nature, purpose, and value of the processes;_\n\n_(III) any risks or harms to consumers actually or potentially arising out of\nthe processes, including physical, financial, psychological, or reputational\nharms;_\n\n_(IV) the adequacy and effect of safeguards implemented by the controllers;_\n\n_(V) the sufficiency of the controller 's notices to consumers at describing\nand obtaining consent concerning the processes; and_\n\n_(VI) the adequacy of the safeguards and monitoring practices of processors\nand third parties to whom the controller has provided personal data._\n\n_(C) The controller must retain risk assessments for at least six years and\nmake risk assessments available to the attorney general upon request._\n\n_(ii) Controllers must develop, implement, and maintain reasonable safeguards\nto protect the security, confidentiality and integrity of the personal data of\nconsumers including adopting reasonable administrative, technical and physical\nsafeguards appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at\nissue._\n\n_(iii) (A) A controller shall limit the use and retention of a consumer 's\npersonal data to what is necessary to provide a service or good requested by a\nconsumer or for purposes for which the consumer has provided freely given,\nspecific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent._\n\n_(B) At least annually, a controller shall review its retention practices for\nthe purpose of ensuring that it is maintaining the minimum amount of personal\ndata as is necessary for the operation of its business. A controller must\ndispose of all personal data that is no longer (I) necessary to provide the\nservices or goods requested by the consumer, (II) necessary for the internal\nbusiness operations of the controller and consistent with the disclosures made\nto the consumer pursuant to section twelve hundred two of this article, or\n(III) necessary to comply with the legal obligations of the controller._\n\n_(iv) Controllers shall be under a continuing obligation to engage in\nreasonable measures to review their activities for circumstances that may have\naltered their ability to identify a specific natural person and to update\ntheir classifications of data as identified or identifiable accordingly._\n\n_(d) Non-discrimination. (i) A controller must not discriminate against a\nconsumer for exercising rights under this article, including but not limited\nto, by:_\n\n_(A) denying services or goods to consumers;_\n\n_(B) charging different prices for services or goods, including through the\nuse of discounts or other benefits; imposing penalties; or providing a\ndifferent level or quality of services or goods to the consumer; or_\n\n_(C) suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for\nservices or goods or a different level or quality of services or goods._\n\n_(ii) This paragraph does not apply to a controller 's conduct with respect to\nopt-in consent, in which case paragraph (j) of subdivision two of section\ntwelve hundred two of this article governs._\n\n_(e) Agreements with processors. (i) Before making any disclosure, transfer,\nor sale of personal data to any processor, the controller must enter into a\nwritten, signed contract with that processor. Such contract must be binding\nand clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose\nof processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of\nprocessing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract must\nalso include requirements that the processor must:_\n\n_(A) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of\nconfidentiality with respect to the data;_\n\n_(B) protect the data in a manner consistent with the requirements of this\narticle and at least equal to the security requirements of the controller set\nforth in their publicly available policies, notices, or similar statements;_\n\n_(C) process the data only when and to the extent necessary to comply with its\nlegal obligations to the controller unless otherwise explicitly authorized by\nthe controller;_\n\n_(D) not combine the personal data which the processor receives from or on\nbehalf of the controller with personal data which the processor receives from\nor on behalf of another person or collects from its own interaction with\nconsumers;_\n\n_(E) comply with any exercises of a consumer 's rights under section twelve\nhundred two of this article upon the request of the controller, subject to the\nlimitations set forth in section twelve hundred five of this article;_\n\n_(F) at the controller 's direction, delete or return all personal data to the\ncontroller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless\nretention of the personal data is required by law;_\n\n_(G) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the\ncontroller all data in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor\n's compliance with the obligations in this article;_\n\n_(H) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or\nthe controller 's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may\narrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of\nthe processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support\nof the obligations under this article using an appropriate and accepted\ncontrol standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments.\nThe processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon\nrequest;_\n\n_(I) a reasonable time in advance before disclosing or transferring the data\nto any further processors, notify the controller of such a proposed disclosure\nor transfer and provide the controller an opportunity to approve or reject the\nproposal; and_\n\n_(J) engage any further processor pursuant to a written, signed contract that\nincludes the contractual requirements provided in this paragraph, containing\nat minimum the same obligations that the processor has entered into with\nregard to the data._\n\n_(ii) A controller must not agree to indemnify, defend, or hold a processor\nharmless, or agree to a provision that has the effect of indemnifying,\ndefending, or holding the processor harmless, from claims or liability arising\nfrom the processor 's breach of the contract required by clause (A) of\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph or a violation of this article. Any\nprovision of an agreement that violates this subparagraph is contrary to\npublic policy and is void and unenforceable._\n\n_(iii) Nothing in this paragraph relieves a controller or a processor from the\nliabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship\nas defined by this article._\n\n_(iv) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with\nrespect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that\ndepends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A\nprocessor that continues to adhere to a controller 's instructions with\nrespect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor._\n\n_(f) Third parties. (i) A controller must not share, disclose, transfer, or\nsell personal data, or facilitate or enable the processing, disclosure,\ntransfer, or sale of personal data to a third party for which consent of the\nconsumer pursuant to subdivision two of section twelve hundred two of this\narticle, has not been obtained or is not currently in effect. Any request for\nconsent to share, disclose, transfer, or sell personal data, or to facilitate\nor enable the processing, disclosure, transfer, or sale of personal data to a\nthird party must clearly include the identity of the third party and the\nprocessing purposes for which the third party may use the personal data._\n\n_(ii) A controller must not share, disclose, transfer, or sell personal data,\nor facilitate or enable the processing, disclosure, transfer, or sale of\npersonal data if it can reasonably expect the personal data of a consumer to\nbe used for purposes that the consumer has not consented to pursuant to\nsubdivision two of section twelve hundred two of this article, or if it can\nreasonably expect that any rights of the consumer provided in this article\nwould be compromised as a result of such transaction._\n\n_(iii) Before making any disclosure, transfer, or sale of personal data to any\nthird party, the controller must enter into a written, signed contract. Such\ncontract must be binding and the scope, nature, and purpose of processing, the\ntype of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights\nand obligations of both parties. Such contract must include requirements that\nthe third party:_\n\n_(A) Process that data only to the extent permitted by the agreement entered\ninto with the controller; and_\n\n_(B) Provide a mechanism to comply with any exercises of a consumer 's rights\nunder section twelve hundred two of this article upon the request of the\ncontroller, subject to any limitations thereon as authorized by this article;\nand_\n\n_(C) To the extent the disclosure, transfer, or sale of the personal data\ncauses the third party to become a controller, comply with all obligations\nimposed on controllers under this article._\n\n_2\\. Processor responsibilities. (a) For any personal data that is obtained,\nreceived, purchased, or otherwise acquired by a processor, whether directly\nfrom a controller or indirectly from another processor, the processor must\ncomply with the requirements set forth in clauses (A) through (J) of\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (e) of subdivision one of this section._\n\n_(b) A processor is not required to comply with a request by the consumer\nsubmitted pursuant to this article by a consumer directly to the processor to\nthe extent that the processor has processed the consumer 's personal data\nsolely in its role as a processor for a controller._\n\n_(c) Processors shall be under a continuing obligation to engage in reasonable\nmeasures to review their activities for circumstances that may have altered\ntheir ability to identify a specific natural person and to update their\nclassifications of data as identified or identifiable accordingly._\n\n_(d) A processor shall not engage in any sale of personal data other than on\nbehalf of the controller pursuant to any agreement entered into with the\ncontroller._\n\n_3\\. Third party responsibilities. (a) For any personal data that is obtained,\nreceived, purchased, or otherwise acquired or accessed by a third party from a\ncontroller or processor, the third party must:_\n\n_(i) Process that data only to the extent permitted by any agreements entered\ninto with the controller;_\n\n_(ii) Process only the personal data necessary for purposes for which freely\ngiven, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent is in effect, as\nconveyed by the controller, limit the use and retention of that data to what\nis necessary for such purposes, and shall immediately delete such personal\ndata when notified that the consent is withheld, denied, or withdrawn;_\n\n_(iii) Comply with any exercises of a consumer 's rights under section twelve\nhundred two of this article upon the request of the controller or processor,\nsubject to any limitations thereon as authorized by this article; and_\n\n_(iv) To the extent the third party becomes a controller for personal data,\ncomply with all obligations imposed on controllers under this article._\n\n_4\\. Exceptions. The requirements of this section shall not apply where:_\n\n_(a) The processing is required by law;_\n\n_(b) The processing is made pursuant to a request by a federal, state, or\nlocal government or government entity; or_\n\n_(c) The processing significantly advances protection against criminal or\ntortious activity._\n\n_Section 1204.
