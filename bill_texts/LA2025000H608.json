Infrastructure requirements</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">A. As established in this Chapter, scientific dimensions of solar radiation modification include the use of interoperable ground-based, airborne, and space-based facilities involving the release of pollutants including radiation.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">B. There are ever-increasing numbers of pollution-generating, microwave-irradiating instruments used in weather experimentation, including but not limited to ground-based facilities interoperable with drones and satellites. The infrastructure and the electrical grid are susceptible to radiation interference and cyber-attacks, potentially leading to accidents, fatalities, damage to critical infrastructure, possible collapse of commerce systems and the failure of essential public utilities, costing the state billions of dollars. Therefore, communications infrastructure shall be subject to evaluation by an independent licensed radio frequency engineer paid for by the facility owner. This evaluation must be completed by January 1, 2026 and then annually on each January 1st thereafter. The radio frequency engineer shall provide findings in a report to be submitted to the local sheriff. Radiation signal strength metered at the reported location shall not exceed -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or channel band specified by a transmitting entity&rsquo; s Federal Communications Commission transmission license; or, maximum power output limit from all frequencies and antennas from a wireless facility shall not exceed 0.1 watts of effective radiated power so as to provide -75 dBm signal strength at a half mile, or five bars on a cell phone. If signal strength metered by a radio frequency engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility operator has thirty days to achieve compliance without disruption to performance of personal wireless services. Failure to comply will result in a fine of not less than five hundred thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is out of compliance. All public and private entities operating in the state must comply with these guidelines.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">C.

There are ever-increasing numbers of pollution-generating, microwave-irradiating instruments used in weather experimentation, including but not limited to ground-based facilities interoperable with drones and satellites. The infrastructure and the electrical grid are susceptible to radiation interference and cyber-attacks, potentially leading to accidents, fatalities, damage to critical infrastructure, possible collapse of commerce systems and the failure of essential public utilities, costing the state billions of dollars. Therefore, communications infrastructure shall be subject to evaluation by an independent licensed radio frequency engineer paid for by the facility owner. This evaluation must be completed by January 1, 2026 and then annually on each January 1st thereafter. The radio frequency engineer shall provide findings in a report to be submitted to the local sheriff. Radiation signal strength metered at the reported location shall not exceed -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or channel band specified by a transmitting entity&rsquo; s Federal Communications Commission transmission license; or, maximum power output limit from all frequencies and antennas from a wireless facility shall not exceed 0.1 watts of effective radiated power so as to provide -75 dBm signal strength at a half mile, or five bars on a cell phone. If signal strength metered by a radio frequency engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility operator has thirty days to achieve compliance without disruption to performance of personal wireless services. Failure to comply will result in a fine of not less than five hundred thousand dollars per day for each day the facility is out of compliance. All public and private entities operating in the state must comply with these guidelines.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">C. To ensure the economic protection and privacy of residents of the state of Louisiana, the safe and secure deployment of hard-wired, fiber-optic connections to the premises of homes, schools, and businesses shall be required, thereby providing the ability to conduct financial transactions and complete life-saving communications in the event that electronic interactions by existing means are compromised, restricted, or otherwise not possible. To safeguard privacy, consumer choice options including non-wireless routers, modems, and mechanical analog utility meters, within a home, property, or business shall be offered to customers without additional fees.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect; 2596.

Therefore, communications infrastructure shall be subject to\nevaluation by an independent licensed radio frequency engineer paid for by the\nfacility owner. This evaluation must be completed by January 1, 2026, and then\nannually on each January first thereafter. The radio frequency engineer shall\nprovide findings in a report to be submitted to the Louisiana Department of\nEnvironmental Quality. Radiation signal strength metered at the reported\nlocation shall not exceed -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt) for any frequency or\nchannel band specified by a transmitting entity 's Federal Communications\nCommission transmission license; or, maximum power output limit from all\nfrequencies and antennas from a wireless facility shall not exceed 0.1 watts\nof effective radiated power so as to provide -75 dBm signal strength at a half\nmile, or five bars on a cell phone. If signal strength metered by a radio\nfrequency engineer is in excess of -75 dBm (decibel-milliwatt), the facility\noperator has thirty days to achieve compliance without disruption to\nperformance of personal wireless services. Failure to comply will result in a\nfine of not less than five hundred thousand dollars per day for each day the\nfacility is out of compliance. All public and private entities operating in\nthe state must comply with these guidelines. _\n\n_C. To ensure the economic protection and privacy of residents of the state of\nLouisiana, the safe and secure deployment of hard-wired, fiber-optic\nconnections to the premises of homes, schools, and businesses shall be\nrequired, thereby providing the ability to conduct financial transactions and\ncomplete life-saving communications in the event that electronic interactions\nby existing means are compromised, restricted, or otherwise not possible. To\nsafeguard privacy, consumer choice options including non-wireless routers,\nmodems, and mechanical analog utility meters, within a home, property, or\nbusiness shall be offered to customers without additional fees._\n\n_§ 2596\\. Atmospheric protection fund _\n\n_A. There is hereby created in the state treasury as a special fund the\nAtmospheric Protection Fund, hereinafter referred to in this Section as the\n\"fund\". Monies transferred to the fund shall be deposited by the state\ntreasurer after compliance with the requirements of Article VII, Section 9(B)\nof the Constitution of Louisiana relative to the Bond Security and Redemption\nFund. Monies in the fund shall be invested in the same manner as monies in the\nstate general fund, and unexpended and unencumbered monies in the fund at the\nend of the fiscal year shall remain in the fund. Interest earned on the\ninvestment of monies in the fund shall be deposited in and credited to the\nfund. _\n\n_B. All money collected as fines under this Chapter shall be deposited into\nthe Atmospheric Protection Fund._\n\nSection 2.
