and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) evading the control of its developer or user.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">For the purposes of this definition, a harm inflicted by an intervening human actor does not result from the developer&#39;s activities unless those activities make it substantially easier or more likely for the actor to inflict the harm.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Deploy&quot; means to use a foundation model or to make a foundation model foreseeably available to one or more third parties for use, modification, copying, or combination with other software, except as reasonably necessary for developing the foundation model or evaluating the foundation model or other foundation models.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Developer&quot; means a person that has trained at least one foundation model with a quantity of computational power that costs at least $100,000,000 when measured using prevailing market prices of cloud computing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">&quot;Employee&quot;

Redactions. If a developer publishes documents in order to comply with this Act, the developer may make redactions to those documents that are reasonably necessary to protect the developer&#39;s trade secrets, public safety, or the national security of the United States or to comply with any federal or State law. If a developer redacts information in a document, the developer shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) retain an unredacted version of the document for at least 5 years and allow the Attorney General to inspect the unredacted version of the document upon request; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) describe the character and justification of the redaction in any published version of the document, to the extent permitted by the concerns that justify redaction.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 25. Audits.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) At least once every calendar year, a developer shall retain a reputable third-party auditor to produce a report assessing the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) whether the developer has complied with its safety and security protocol and any instances of noncompliance or ambiguous compliance;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) any instances where the developer&#39;s safety and security protocol has not been stated clearly enough to determine whether the developer has complied; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) any instances where the auditor believes the developer may have violated subsection (d) of Section 15 or Section 20.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A developer shall allow the third-party auditor access to all materials produced to comply with this Act and any other materials reasonably necessary to perform the assessment required under subsection (a).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) No later than 90 days after the completion of the third-party auditor&#39;s report required under subsection (a), the developer shall conspicuously publish the report.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 30. Whistleblower protections.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The provisions of the Whistleblower Act shall apply to this Act, except that the criminal penalties provided in the Whistleblower Act shall not be assessed in reference to this Act, in cases where an employee of a developer discloses information to the Attorney General and the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information indicates that the developer&#39;s activities pose unreasonable or substantial critical risk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) A developer shall provide a reasonable internal process through which an employee may anonymously disclose information to the developer if the employee believes in good faith that information indicates that the developer&#39;s activities present an unreasonable critical risk, including a monthly update to the person who made the disclosure regarding the status of the developer&#39;s investigation of the disclosure and the actions taken by the developer in response to the disclosure.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The disclosures and responses of the process required by this Section shall be maintained for a minimum of 7 years after the date when the disclosure is made to the developer or the response to the disclosure is made by the developer. Each disclosure and response shall be shared with the officers and directors of the developer who do not have a conflict of interest no less frequently than once every fiscal quarter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 35. Enforcement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The Attorney General may bring a civil action against a developer that violates Sections 15 or 25. A developer found guilty of violating Sections 15 or 25 may be assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000,000. In calculating the civil penalty assessed under this subsection, a court shall consider the severity of the violation and whether the violation resulted in, or could have resulted in, the materialization of a critical risk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The Attorney General may seek injunctive or declaratory relief for any violation of this Act. The Attorney General may seek injunctive relief if a developer&#39;s activities present an imminent threat of catastrophic harm to the public.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) In determining whether a developer&#39;s act or omission breached its common law duty to take reasonable care with respect to critical risks, the following considerations are relevant but not conclusive:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the quality of the developer&#39;s safety and security protocol and the extent of the developer&#39;s adherence to it;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) whether, in quality and implementation, the developer&#39;s investigation, documentation, evaluation, and management of critical risks was inferior, comparable, or superior to other developers of foundation models that may pose comparable critical risk;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the extent to which the developer responsibly informed the public of critical risks posed by its foundation models; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) whether the societal benefit produced by the developer&#39;s act or omission outweighed the associated critical risk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 40. Other duties required by law. The duties and obligations imposed by this Act are cumulative with any other duties or obligations imposed under other law and shall not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or obligations imposed under other law and do not limit any rights or remedies under existing law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 97. Severability. The provisions of this Act are severable under Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",
