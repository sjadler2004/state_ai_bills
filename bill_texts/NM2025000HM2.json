journeys through school and into the workforce, educators who need information that allows them to quickly target interventions where they are needed and policymakers who need data to evaluate whether investments are improving educational outcomes for students statewide; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, strong program evaluations rely on a foundation of high-quality data that is accurate, complete, consistent, granular and timely; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, recent legislative education study committee staff analysis of educational programs has met complications due to poor-quality data, resulting in ambiguity in the analysis of program effectiveness; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, data quality issues occur when schools and school districts have difficulties reporting reliable information or when data systems are created in administrative silos; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, many state agencies, including the public education department, the higher education department, the early childhood education and care department, the children, youth and families department, the workforce solutions department, the vocational rehabilitation division of the public education department and the department of information technology, are independently working on data systems and improvements, but a lack of collaboration and coordination may perpetuate issues with data quality; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, data quality can be improved through data governance, a set of rules, policies and standards designed to promote greater organizational collaboration, higher quality data and improved usability of data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, artificial intelligence is a powerful new technology that can create new opportunities for students, educators and researchers to expand and deepen learning, but also creates new uncertainties about what the definition of &quot;data&quot; might include; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, some artificial intelligence systems may be given extensive access to educational datasets, personally identifiable information and culturally sensitive data, creating novel conditions for data governance policies, especially regarding the data of Indian nations, tribes and pueblos in the state; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the advent of artificial intelligence warrants a set of rules and policies governing its use in educational institutions, especially to ensure that artificial intelligence tools are used effectively and responsibly, are accessible to all communities across New Mexico, are tailored to New Mexico&#39;s cultural and educational contexts and are not used as a substitute for meaningful human connection; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, many states have established a statutory structure for data governance, allowing state agencies and data users to collaborate on effective policies to improve data quality, particularly to ensure that statewide longitudinal data systems provide actionable, accessible and timely information; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the RISE NM statewide longitudinal data system is under construction at the higher education department; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, state agencies that contribute data to the RISE NM system have a variety of mechanisms and internal processes to manage data transfers, but there is not a central mechanism to enforce data quality; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the legislature has appropriated funds to the institute for complex additive systems analysis at the New Mexico institute of mining and technology to conduct an assessment of data governance policies and assets at various state agencies; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, to ensure that data is high quality, New Mexico would benefit from a coordinated approach to data governance among the many agencies working on data systems that honors the progress state agencies are making on data systems while still working to improve data quality; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, state agencies should collaborate and communicate in the creation of a statewide education governance framework given their deep knowledge of their data systems, as well as to foster an understanding of the needs of stakeholders that rely on timely access to data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF NEW MEXICO that the legislative education study committee be requested to convene an education data governance and artificial intelligence working group throughout the 2025 legislative interim;

Baca\n\nFOR THE LEGISLATIVE EDUCATION STUDY COMMITTEE\n\nA MEMORIAL\n\nREQUESTING THE LEGISLATIVE EDUCATION STUDY COMMITTEE TO ASSEMBLE AN EDUCATION\nDATA GOVERNANCE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WORKING GROUP TO STUDY AND\nRECOMMEND A STRUCTURE FOR IMPROVED STATEWIDE EDUCATION DATA GOVERNANCE AND\nPOLICIES TO ADDRESS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.\n\nWHEREAS, access to high-quality data is important for stakeholders throughout\nNew Mexico's education community, including families who need data to answer\nquestions about students' journeys through school and into the workforce,\neducators who need information that allows them to quickly target\ninterventions where they are needed and policymakers who need data to evaluate\nwhether investments are improving educational outcomes for students statewide;\nand\n\nWHEREAS, strong program evaluations rely on a foundation of high-quality data\nthat is accurate, complete, consistent, granular and timely; and\n\nWHEREAS, recent legislative education study committee staff analysis of\neducational programs has met complications due to poor-quality data, resulting\nin ambiguity in the analysis of program effectiveness; and\n\nWHEREAS, data quality issues occur when schools and school districts have\ndifficulties reporting reliable information or when data systems are created\nin administrative silos; and\n\nWHEREAS, many state agencies, including the public education department, the\nhigher education department, the early childhood education and care\ndepartment, the children, youth and families department, the workforce\nsolutions department, the vocational rehabilitation division of the public\neducation department and the department of information technology, are\nindependently working on data systems and improvements, but a lack of\ncollaboration and coordination may perpetuate issues with data quality; and\n\nWHEREAS, data quality can be improved through data governance, a set of rules,\npolicies and standards designed to promote greater organizational\ncollaboration, higher quality data and improved usability of data; and\n\nWHEREAS, artificial intelligence is a powerful new technology that can create\nnew opportunities for students, educators and researchers to expand and deepen\nlearning, but also creates new uncertainties about what the definition of\n\"data\" might include; and\n\nWHEREAS, some artificial intelligence systems may be given extensive access to\neducational datasets, personally identifiable information and culturally\nsensitive data, creating novel conditions for data governance policies,\nespecially regarding the data of Indian nations, tribes and pueblos in the\nstate; and\n\nWHEREAS, the advent of artificial intelligence warrants a set of rules and\npolicies governing its use in educational institutions, especially to ensure\nthat artificial intelligence tools are used effectively and responsibly, are\naccessible to all communities across New Mexico, are tailored to New Mexico's\ncultural and educational contexts and are not used as a substitute for\nmeaningful human connection; and\n\nWHEREAS, many states have established a statutory structure for data\ngovernance, allowing state agencies and data users to collaborate on effective\npolicies to improve data quality, particularly to ensure that statewide\nlongitudinal data systems provide actionable, accessible and timely\ninformation; and\n\nWHEREAS, the RISE NM statewide longitudinal data system is under construction\nat the higher education department; and\n\nWHEREAS, state agencies that contribute data to the RISE NM system have a\nvariety of mechanisms and internal processes to manage data transfers, but\nthere is not a central mechanism to enforce data quality; and\n\nWHEREAS, the legislature has appropriated funds to the institute for complex\nadditive systems analysis at the New Mexico institute of mining and technology\nto conduct an assessment of data governance policies and assets at various\nstate agencies; and\n\nWHEREAS, to ensure that data is high quality, New Mexico would benefit from a\ncoordinated approach to data governance among the many agencies working on\ndata systems that honors the progress state agencies are making on data\nsystems while still working to improve data quality; and\n\nWHEREAS, state agencies should collaborate and communicate in the creation of\na statewide education governance framework given their deep knowledge of their\ndata systems, as well as to foster an understanding of the needs of\nstakeholders that rely on timely access to data;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF\nNEW MEXICO that the legislative education study committee be requested to\nconvene an education data governance and artificial intelligence working group\nthroughout the 2025 legislative interim;
