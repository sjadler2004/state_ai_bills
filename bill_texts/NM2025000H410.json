[<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] CONSUMER RIGHTS.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this section at any time by submitting a request to a controller specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A known child&#39;s parent or legal guardian may invoke such consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding processing personal data belonging to the known child. A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) to confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer&#39;s personal data and to access such personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) to correct inaccuracies in the consumer&#39;s personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer&#39;s personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) to delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) to obtain a copy of the consumer&#39;s personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal data or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable means established by the controller and described to the consumer in the controller&#39;s privacy notice. In the case of processing personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on the child&#39;s behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such rights on the consumer&#39;s behalf.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to Subsection A of this section as follows:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) a controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within forty-five days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to the methods described in Subsection A of this section. The response period may be extended once by forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer&#39;s requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial forty-five-day response period, together with the reason for the extension;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) if a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer&#39;s request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within forty-five days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision pursuant to Subsection D of this section;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under Subsection A of this section and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer&#39;s request; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer&#39;s request to delete such data pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section by either:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer&#39;s personal data remains deleted from the business&#39;s records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller&#39;s refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer&#39;s receipt of the decision pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection C of this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to Subsection A of this section. Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 5. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--TRANSPARENCY.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A controller shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer&#39;s consent;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data. Data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer&#39;s right to opt out pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act or the offer is related to a consumer&#39;s voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer&#39;s consent or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the purpose for processing personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller&#39;s decision with regard to the consumer&#39;s request;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act but may require a consumer to use an existing account.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, no controller shall process any personal data collected from a known child:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of such personal data or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product or feature;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed purpose; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product, or feature.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, no controller shall collect precise geolocation data from a known child unless:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) such precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller to provide an online service, product or feature and, if such data is necessary to provide such online service, product or feature, such controller shall only collect such data for the time necessary to provide such online service, product or feature; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the controller provides to the known child a signal indicating that such controller is collecting such precise geolocation data, which signal shall be available to such known child for the entire duration of such collection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H. No controller shall engage in the activities described in Subsections F and G of Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act unless the controller obtains consent from the child&#39;s parent or legal guardian in accordance with the federal Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 6. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Such assistance shall include:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller&#39;s obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller&#39;s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security of the system of the processor pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act in order to meet the controller&#39;s obligations; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor&#39;s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) at the controller&#39;s direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor&#39;s compliance with the obligations in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller&#39;s designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor&#39;s policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller&#39;s instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 7. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the sale of personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) other substantial injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the processing of sensitive data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The attorney general may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in Subsection A of this section. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under the Inspection of Public Records Act. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general shall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated after the effective date of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act and are not retroactive.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 8. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] PROCESSING DE-IDENTIFIED DATA.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The controller in possession of de-identified data shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural person;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data or maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request, pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, if all of the following are true:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. The consumer rights contained in Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 9. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] LIMITATIONS.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to restrict a controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s ability to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) comply with federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or summons by federal, state, local or other governmental authorities;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to entering into a contract;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or any illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored and governed by an institutional review board or similar independent oversight entities that determine:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) if the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) if the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not restrict a controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s ability to collect, use or retain data to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or technology;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) effectuate a product recall;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer&#39;s existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with that act would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state. Nothing in that act shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged communication.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, is not in violation of that act if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal data is in violation of that act; provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of that act is likewise not in violation of that act for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which it receives such personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States constitution, or applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use or retention of personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in Subsection F of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in Subsection A of this section shall not solely make an entity a controller with respect to such processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 10. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY.--Whenever the attorney general has reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged in, is engaging in or is about to engage in any violation of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, the attorney general is empowered to issue a civil investigative demand.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 11. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] ENFORCEMENT--CIVIL PENALTIES.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The attorney general shall have exclusive authority to enforce the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Prior to initiating any action under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, the attorney general shall provide a controller or processor thirty days&#39; written notice identifying the specific provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated. If within the thirty-day period the controller or processor cures the noticed violation and provides the attorney general an express written statement that the alleged violations have been cured and that no further violations shall occur, no action shall be initiated against the controller or processor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. If a controller or processor continues to violate the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act following the cure period in Subsection B of this section or breaches an express written statement provided to the attorney general under that subsection, the attorney general may initiate an action and may seek an injunction to restrain any violations of that act and civil penalties of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation under that act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. The attorney general may recover reasonable expenses incurred in investigating and preparing the case, including attorney fees, in any action initiated under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed as providing the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for violations of that act or under any other law.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

[_NEW MATERIAL_] CONSUMER RIGHTS.--\n\nA. A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this\nsection at any time by submitting a request to a controller specifying the\nconsumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A known child's parent or legal\nguardian may invoke such consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding\nprocessing personal data belonging to the known child. A controller shall\ncomply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right:\n\n(1) to confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's\npersonal data and to access such personal data;\n\n(2) to correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into\naccount the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of\nthe consumer's personal data;\n\n(3) to delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;\n\n(4) to obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer\npreviously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent\ntechnically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to\ntransmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the\nprocessing is carried out by automated means; and\n\n(5) to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted\nadvertising, the sale of personal data or profiling in furtherance of\ndecisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the\nconsumer.\n\nB. A consumer may exercise rights under this section by a secure and reliable\nmeans established by the controller and described to the consumer in the\ncontroller's privacy notice. In the case of processing personal data of a\nknown child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on\nthe child's behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a\nconsumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship or other protective\narrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such\nrights on the consumer's behalf.\n\nC. Except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to\nexercise the consumer rights authorized pursuant to Subsection A of this\nsection as follows:\n\n(1) a controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all\ncases within forty-five days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to\nthe methods described in Subsection A of this section. The response period may\nbe extended once by forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary,\ntaking into account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so\nlong as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the\ninitial forty-five-day response period, together with the reason for the\nextension;\n\n(2) if a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request,\nthe controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases\nand at the latest within forty-five days of receipt of the request, of the\njustification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal\nthe decision pursuant to Subsection D of this section;\n\n(3) information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided\nby a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests\nfrom a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the\ncontroller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the\nadministrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the\nrequest. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly\nunfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request;\n\n(4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially\nreasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a\nrequest to initiate an action under Subsection A of this section and may\nrequest that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary\nto authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request; and\n\n(5) a controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a\nsource other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's\nrequest to delete such data pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this\nsection by either:\n\n(a) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary\nfor the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from\nthe business's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose\npursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection\nAct; or\n\n(b) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any\npurpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act.\n\nD. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the\ncontroller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of\ntime after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to Paragraph (2) of\nSubsection C of this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously\navailable and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate\naction pursuant to Subsection A of this section. Within sixty days of receipt\nof an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action\ntaken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation\nof the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller\nshall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or\nother method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to\nsubmit a complaint.\n\nSECTION 5. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--TRANSPARENCY.--\n\nA. A controller shall:\n\n(1) limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and\nreasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is\nprocessed, as disclosed to the consumer;\n\n(2) except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act, not process personal data for purposes that are neither\nreasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which\nsuch personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the\ncontroller obtains the consumer's consent;\n\n(3) establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and\nphysical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and\naccessibility of personal data. Data security practices shall be appropriate\nto the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;\n\n(4) not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that\nprohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not\ndiscriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights\ncontained in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, including\ndenying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or\nservices or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to\nthe consumer. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to\nrequire a controller to provide a product or service that requires the\npersonal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain\nor to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level,\nquality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering\ngoods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer's\nright to opt out pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act or the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation\nin a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card\nprogram; and\n\n(5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the\nconsumer's consent or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data\nconcerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the\nfederal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section\n6501 et seq.).\n\nB. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive\nor limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be\nvoid and unenforceable.\n\nC. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear\nand meaningful privacy notice that includes:\n\n(1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;\n\n(2) the purpose for processing personal data;\n\n(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer\nmay appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;\n\n(4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third\nparties, if any;\n\n(5) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller shares\npersonal data; and\n\n(6) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the\nconsumer may use to contact the controller.\n\nD. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal\ndata for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously\ndisclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may\nexercise the right to opt out of such processing.\n\nE. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one\nor more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to\nexercise their consumer rights under the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers\nnormally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable\ncommunication of such requests and the ability of the controller to\nauthenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers\nshall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise\nconsumer rights pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act but may require a consumer to use an existing account.\n\nF. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, no controller shall process any personal\ndata collected from a known child:\n\n(1) for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of such personal data\nor profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly\nsignificant effects concerning a consumer;\n\n(2) unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online\nservice, product or feature;\n\n(3) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the\ncontroller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data\nor that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed\npurpose; or\n\n(4) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service,\nproduct, or feature.\n\nG. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, no controller shall collect precise\ngeolocation data from a known child unless:\n\n(1) such precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller\nto provide an online service, product or feature and, if such data is\nnecessary to provide such online service, product or feature, such controller\nshall only collect such data for the time necessary to provide such online\nservice, product or feature; and\n\n(2) the controller provides to the known child a signal indicating that such\ncontroller is collecting such precise geolocation data, which signal shall be\navailable to such known child for the entire duration of such collection.\n\nH. No controller shall engage in the activities described in Subsections F and\nG of Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act unless the\ncontroller obtains consent from the child's parent or legal guardian in\naccordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998\n(15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).\n\nSECTION 6. [_NEW MATERIAL_] RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR.--\n\nA. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall\nassist the controller in meeting its obligations under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act. Such assistance shall include:\n\n(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures,\ninsofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's\nobligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 4 of the\nConsumer Information and Data Protection Act;\n\n(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's\nobligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in\nrelation to the notification of a breach of security of the system of the\nprocessor pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act in\norder to meet the controller's obligations; and\n\n(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and\ndocument data protection assessments pursuant to the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act.\n\nB. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the\nprocessor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on\nbehalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth\ninstructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the\ntype of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights\nand obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements\nthat the processor shall:\n\n(1) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of\nconfidentiality with respect to the data;\n\n(2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the\ncontroller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless\nretention of the personal data is required by law;\n\n(3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the\ncontroller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the\nprocessor's compliance with the obligations in the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act;\n\n(4) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the\ncontroller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for\na qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the\nprocessor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of\nthe obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act using\nan appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment\nprocedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such\nassessment to the controller upon request; and\n\n(5) engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with\nthis section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the\nprocessor with respect to the personal data.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a\nprocessor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the\nprocessing relationship as defined by the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act.\n\nD. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with\nrespect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that\ndepends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A\nprocessor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect\nto a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.\n\nSECTION 7. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS.--\n\nA. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of\neach of the following processing activities involving personal data:\n\n(1) the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;\n\n(2) the sale of personal data;\n\n(3) the processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such\nprofiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:\n\n(a) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,\nconsumers;\n\n(b) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;\n\n(c) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the\nprivate affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be\noffensive to a reasonable person; or\n\n(d) other substantial injury to consumers;\n\n(4) the processing of sensitive data; and\n\n(5) any processing activities involving personal data that present a\nheightened risk of harm to consumers.\n\nB. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to Subsection A of this\nsection shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and\nindirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other\nstakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the\nconsumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can\nbe employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified\ndata and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of\nthe processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer\nwhose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment\nby the controller.\n\nC. The attorney general may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand,\nthat a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to\nan investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall\nmake the data protection assessment available to the attorney general. The\nattorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance\nwith the responsibilities set forth in Subsection A of this section. Data\nprotection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from public inspection\nand copying under the Inspection of Public Records Act. The disclosure of a\ndata protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general\nshall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product\nprotection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the\nassessment.\n\nD. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of\nprocessing operations that include similar activities.\n\nE. Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of\ncompliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the\nassessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.\n\nF. Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing\nactivities created or generated after the effective date of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act and are not retroactive.\n\nSECTION 8. [_NEW MATERIAL_] PROCESSING DE-IDENTIFIED DATA.--\n\nA. The controller in possession of de-identified data shall:\n\n(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with\na natural person;\n\n(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without\nattempting to re-identify the data; and\n\n(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply\nwith all provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.\n\nB. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified\ndata or pseudonymous data or maintain data in identifiable form, or collect,\nobtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of\nassociating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.\n\nC. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated\nconsumer rights request, pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act, if all of the following are true:\n\n(1) the controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with\nthe personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to\nassociate the request with the personal data;\n\n(2) the controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to\nthe specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the\npersonal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and\n\n(3) the controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or\notherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than\na processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.\n\nD. The consumer rights contained in Section 4 of the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the\ncontroller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the\nconsumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and\norganizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such\ninformation.\n\nE. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall\nexercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual\ncommitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject\nand shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual\ncommitments.\n\nSECTION 9. [_NEW MATERIAL_] LIMITATIONS.--\n\nA. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:\n\n(1) comply with federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;\n\n(2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation,\nsubpoena or summons by federal, state, local or other governmental\nauthorities;\n\n(3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity\nthat the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may\nviolate federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;\n\n(4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;\n\n(5) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, perform\na contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of\na written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to\nentering into a contract;\n\n(6) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life\nor physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person and where the\nprocessing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;\n\n(7) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents,\nidentity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or any\nillegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or\ninvestigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action;\n\n(8) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in\nthe public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy\nlaws and is approved, monitored and governed by an institutional review board\nor similar independent oversight entities that determine:\n\n(a) if the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial\nbenefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;\n\n(b) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and\n\n(c) if the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate\nprivacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with\nre-identification; or\n\n(9) assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the\nobligations under this subsection.\n\nB. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act shall not restrict a controller's or\nprocessor's ability to collect, use or retain data to:\n\n(1) conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services\nor technology;\n\n(2) effectuate a product recall;\n\n(3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended\nfunctionality; or\n\n(4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the\nexpectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's\nexisting relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with\nprocessing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service\nspecifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which\nthe consumer is a party.\n\nC. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act shall not apply where compliance by the\ncontroller or processor with that act would violate an evidentiary privilege\nunder the laws of the state. Nothing in that act shall be construed to prevent\na controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer\nto a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as\npart of a privileged communication.\n\nD. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party\ncontroller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, is not in violation of that act if the\nthird-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal\ndata is in violation of that act; provided that, at the time of disclosing the\npersonal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual\nknowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party\ncontroller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor\nin compliance with the requirements of that act is likewise not in violation\nof that act for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which\nit receives such personal data.\n\nE. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that\nadversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising\nthe right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States\nconstitution, or applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the\ncourse of a purely personal or household activity.\n\nF. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not\nbe processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section\nunless otherwise allowed by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.\nPersonal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be\nprocessed to the extent that such processing is:\n\n(1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this\nsection; and\n\n(2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the\nspecific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or\nretained pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall, where applicable,\ntake into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use\nor retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative,\ntechnical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and\naccessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks\nof harm to consumers relating to such collection, use or retention of personal\ndata.\n\nG. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this\nsection, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing\nqualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in Subsection F\nof this section.\n\nH.

In the case of processing personal data of a known child, the parent or legal guardian may exercise such consumer rights on the child&#39;s behalf. In the case of processing personal data concerning a consumer subject to a guardianship, conservatorship or other protective arrangement, the guardian or the conservator of the consumer may exercise such rights on the consumer&#39;s behalf.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C.

The response period may be extended once by forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer&#39;s requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial forty-five-day response period, together with the reason for the extension;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) if a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer&#39;s request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases and at the latest within forty-five days of receipt of the request, of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal the decision pursuant to Subsection D of this section;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under Subsection A of this section and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer&#39;s request;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) a controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer&#39;s request to delete such data pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this section by either:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer&#39;s personal data remains deleted from the business&#39;s records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) providing an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer&#39;s consent under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer&#39;s consent and, upon revocation of such consent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than fifteen days after the receipt of such request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller&#39;s refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer&#39;s receipt of the decision pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection C of this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to Subsection A of this section. Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 5. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] AUTHORIZED AGENTS AND CONSUMER OPT-OUT.--A consumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer&#39;s authorized agent, and act on such consumer&#39;s behalf, to opt out of the processing of such consumer&#39;s personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. The consumer may designate such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a technology, including, but not limited to, an internet link or a browser setting, browser extension or global device setting, indicating such consumer&#39;s intent to opt out of such processing. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the authorized agent&#39;s authority to act on such consumer&#39;s behalf.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 6. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--TRANSPARENCY.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A controller shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer&#39;s consent;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data. Data security practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer&#39;s right to opt out pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act or the offer is related to a consumer&#39;s voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card program; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer&#39;s consent or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the purpose for processing personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer may appeal a controller&#39;s decision with regard to the consumer&#39;s request;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the consumer may use to contact the controller.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act but may require a consumer to use an existing account.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, no controller shall process any personal data collected from a known child:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of such personal data or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product or feature;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data or that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed purpose; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product or feature.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, no controller shall collect precise geolocation data from a known child unless:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) such precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller to provide an online service, product or feature and, if such data is necessary to provide such online service, product or feature, such controller shall only collect such data for the time necessary to provide such online service, product or feature; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the controller provides to the known child a signal indicating that such controller is collecting such precise geolocation data, which signal shall be available to such known child for the entire duration of such collection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H. No controller shall engage in the activities described in Subsections F and G of Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act unless the controller obtains consent from the child&#39;s parent or legal guardian in accordance with the federal Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 7. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--ONLINE SERVICE, PRODUCT OR FEATURE.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. Each controller that offers an online service, product or feature to consumers who are minors younger than the age of eighteen, whom the controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards that they are minors younger than the age of eighteen, shall use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of harm to such minors caused by the online service, product or feature.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Subject to the consent requirement established in Subsection D of this section, no controller that offers any online service, product or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) process personal data of any minor younger than the age of eighteen for the purposes of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) targeted advertising;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) any sale of personal data; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) profiling in furtherance of any fully automated decision made by such controller that produces any legal or similarly significant effect concerning the provision or denial by such controller of any financial or lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment or opportunity, criminal justice, employment opportunity, health care services or access to essential goods or services, unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product or feature, or for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time the controller collected the personal data, or that is reasonably necessary for, and compatible with, the processing purpose described in this subsection, or for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product or feature; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) use any system design feature to significantly increase, sustain or extend any minor younger than the age of eighteen&#39;s use of such online service, product or feature. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any service or application that is used by and under the direction of an educational entity, including a learning management system or a student engagement program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Subject to the consent requirement established in Subsection D of this section, no controller that offers an online service, product or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards, are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall collect the minor&#39;s precise geolocation data unless:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller to provide the online service, product or feature and, if the data are necessary to provide the online service, product or feature, the controller may only collect the data for the time necessary to provide the online service, product or feature; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the controller provides to the minor a signal indicating that the controller is collecting the precise geolocation data, which signal shall be available to the minor for the entire duration of such collection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. No controller that offers any online service, product or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall engage in the activities described in Subsections B and C of this section unless the controller obtains the consent of the minor younger than the age of eighteen, or, if the minor is younger than thirteen years of age, the consent of the minor&#39;s parent or legal guardian. A controller that complies with the verifiable parental consent requirements established in the federal Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, 1S USC 6501 et seq., and the regulations, rules, guidance and exemptions adopted pursuant to that act, as that act and the regulations, rules, guidance and exemptions may be amended from time to time, shall be deemed to have satisfied any requirement to obtain parental consent under this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. No controller that offers any online service, product or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards, are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) provide any consent mechanism that is designed to substantially subvert or impair, or is manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing, user autonomy, decision-making or choice; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) except as provided in Subsection F of this section, offer any direct messaging apparatus for use by minors without providing readily accessible and easy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of adults to send unsolicited communications to minors with whom they are not connected.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. The provisions of Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section shall not apply to services when the predominant or exclusive function is:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) electronic mail; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) direct messaging consisting of text, photos or videos that are sent between devices by electronic means, if messages are:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) shared between the sender and the recipient;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) only visible to the sender and the recipient; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) not posted publicly.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 8. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--ONLINE SERVICE, PRODUCT OR FEATURE--DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS, REVIEW AND RECORD KEEPING.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. Each controller that, on or after one year after the effective date of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, offers any online service, product or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards, are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall conduct a data protection assessment for such online service, product or feature:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in Section 7 of that act; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) that addresses:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) the purpose of the online service, product or feature;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the categories of minors&#39; personal data that the online service, product or feature processes;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) the purposes for which the controller processes minors&#39; personal data with respect to the online service, product or feature; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) any heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable result of offering the online service, product or feature to minors.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Each controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for any material change to the processing operations of the online service, product or feature that is the subject of the data protection assessment; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the longer of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) the three-year period beginning on the date on which the processing operations cease; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) as long as the controller offers the online service, product or feature.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to Subsection A of this section and determines that the online service, product or feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of harm to minors, the controller shall establish and implement a plan to mitigate or eliminate the risk.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Inspection of Public Records Act. To the extent that any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of the privilege or protection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 9. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Such assistance shall include:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller&#39;s obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller&#39;s obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of security of the system of the processor pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act in order to meet the controller&#39;s obligations; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor&#39;s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) at the controller&#39;s direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor&#39;s compliance with the obligations in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller&#39;s designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor&#39;s policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with this section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the processing relationship as defined by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller&#39;s instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 10. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the sale of personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) other substantial injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) the processing of sensitive data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to Subsection A of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The attorney general may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in Subsection A of this section. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under the Inspection of Public Records Act. The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general shall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing activities created or generated after the effective date of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act and are not retroactive.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 11. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] PROCESSING DE-IDENTIFIED DATA.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The controller in possession of de-identified data shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with a natural person;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re-identify the data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply with all provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data or maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request, pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, if all of the following are true:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) the controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. The consumer rights contained in Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the controller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such information.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 12. [<u>NEW MATERIAL</u>] LIMITATIONS.--</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed to restrict a controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s ability to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) comply with federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena or summons by federal, state, local or other governmental authorities;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, perform a contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to entering into a contract;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or any illegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored and governed by an institutional review board or similar independent oversight entities that determine:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) if the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) if the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with re-identification; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the obligations under this subsection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not restrict a controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s ability to collect, use or retain data to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services or technology;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) effectuate a product recall;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer&#39;s existing relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with that act would violate an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state. Nothing in that act shall be construed to prevent a controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as part of a privileged communication.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, is not in violation of that act if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal data is in violation of that act; provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of that act is likewise not in violation of that act for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which it receives such personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be construed as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States constitution, or applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not be processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section unless otherwise allowed by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed to the extent that such processing is:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or retained pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to such collection, use or retention of personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in Subsection F of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H.

If any provision of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act is found by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of that provision that do not present constitutional vagueness problems shall be severed and remain in force.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly\nunfounded, excessive or repetitive nature of the request;\n\n(4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially\nreasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a\nrequest to initiate an action under Subsection A of this section and may\nrequest that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary\nto authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request;\n\n(5) a controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a\nsource other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's\nrequest to delete such data pursuant to Paragraph (2) of Subsection A of this\nsection by either:\n\n(a) retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary\nfor the purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from\nthe business's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose\npursuant to the provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection\nAct; or\n\n(b) opting the consumer out of the processing of such personal data for any\npurpose except for those exempted pursuant to the provisions of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act; and\n\n(6) providing an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke the consumer's\nconsent under this section that is at least as easy as the mechanism by which\nthe consumer provided the consumer's consent and, upon revocation of such\nconsent, cease to process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than\nfifteen days after the receipt of such request.\n\nD. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the\ncontroller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of\ntime after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to Paragraph (2) of\nSubsection C of this section. The appeal process shall be conspicuously\navailable and similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate\naction pursuant to Subsection A of this section. Within sixty days of receipt\nof an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action\ntaken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation\nof the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller\nshall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or\nother method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to\nsubmit a complaint.\n\nSECTION 5. [_NEW MATERIAL_] AUTHORIZED AGENTS AND CONSUMER OPT-OUT.--A\nconsumer may designate another person to serve as the consumer's authorized\nagent, and act on such consumer's behalf, to opt out of the processing of such\nconsumer's personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in Section\n4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act. The consumer may\ndesignate such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a technology,\nincluding, but not limited to, an internet link or a browser setting, browser\nextension or global device setting, indicating such consumer's intent to opt\nout of such processing. A controller shall comply with an opt-out request\nreceived from an authorized agent if the controller is able to verify, with\ncommercially reasonable effort, the identity of the consumer and the\nauthorized agent's authority to act on such consumer's behalf.\n\nSECTION 6. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--TRANSPARENCY.--\n\nA. A controller shall:\n\n(1) limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and\nreasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is\nprocessed, as disclosed to the consumer;\n\n(2) except as otherwise provided in the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act, not process personal data for purposes that are neither\nreasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which\nsuch personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the\ncontroller obtains the consumer's consent;\n\n(3) establish, implement and maintain reasonable administrative, technical and\nphysical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity and\naccessibility of personal data. Data security practices shall be appropriate\nto the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;\n\n(4) not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that\nprohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not\ndiscriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights\ncontained in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, including\ndenying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or\nservices or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to\nthe consumer. However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to\nrequire a controller to provide a product or service that requires the\npersonal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain\nor to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level,\nquality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering\ngoods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer's\nright to opt out pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act or the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation\nin a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts or club card\nprogram; and\n\n(5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the\nconsumer's consent or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data\nconcerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance with the\nfederal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. Section\n6501 et seq.).\n\nB. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive\nor limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be\nvoid and unenforceable.\n\nC. A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear\nand meaningful privacy notice that includes:\n\n(1) the categories of personal data processed by the controller;\n\n(2) the purpose for processing personal data;\n\n(3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights, including how a consumer\nmay appeal a controller's decision with regard to the consumer's request;\n\n(4) the categories of personal data that the controller shares with third\nparties, if any;\n\n(5) the categories of third parties, if any, with which the controller shares\npersonal data; and\n\n(6) an active electronic mail address or other online mechanism that the\nconsumer may use to contact the controller.\n\nD. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal\ndata for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously\ndisclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may\nexercise the right to opt out of such processing.\n\nE. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one\nor more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to\nexercise their consumer rights under the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act. Such means shall take into account the ways in which consumers\nnormally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable\ncommunication of such requests and the ability of the controller to\nauthenticate the identity of the consumer making the request. Controllers\nshall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise\nconsumer rights pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act but may require a consumer to use an existing account.\n\nF. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, no controller shall process any personal\ndata collected from a known child:\n\n(1) for the purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of such personal data\nor profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly\nsignificant effects concerning a consumer;\n\n(2) unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online\nservice, product or feature;\n\n(3) for any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the\ncontroller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data\nor that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed\npurpose; or\n\n(4) for longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service,\nproduct or feature.\n\nG. Subject to the consent requirement established by Section 4 of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, no controller shall collect precise\ngeolocation data from a known child unless:\n\n(1) such precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller\nto provide an online service, product or feature and, if such data is\nnecessary to provide such online service, product or feature, such controller\nshall only collect such data for the time necessary to provide such online\nservice, product or feature; and\n\n(2) the controller provides to the known child a signal indicating that such\ncontroller is collecting such precise geolocation data, which signal shall be\navailable to such known child for the entire duration of such collection.\n\nH. No controller shall engage in the activities described in Subsections F and\nG of Section 4 of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act unless the\ncontroller obtains consent from the child's parent or legal guardian in\naccordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998\n(15 U.S.C. Section 6501 et seq.).\n\nSECTION 7. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--ONLINE SERVICE,\nPRODUCT OR FEATURE.--\n\nA. Each controller that offers an online service, product or feature to\nconsumers who are minors younger than the age of eighteen, whom the controller\nhas actual knowledge or willfully disregards that they are minors younger than\nthe age of eighteen, shall use reasonable care to avoid any heightened risk of\nharm to such minors caused by the online service, product or feature.\n\nB. Subject to the consent requirement established in Subsection D of this\nsection, no controller that offers any online service, product or feature to\nconsumers whom the controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards are\nminors younger than the age of eighteen shall:\n\n(1) process personal data of any minor younger than the age of eighteen for\nthe purposes of:\n\n(a) targeted advertising;\n\n(b) any sale of personal data; or\n\n(c) profiling in furtherance of any fully automated decision made by such\ncontroller that produces any legal or similarly significant effect concerning\nthe provision or denial by such controller of any financial or lending\nservices, housing, insurance, education enrollment or opportunity, criminal\njustice, employment opportunity, health care services or access to essential\ngoods or services, unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide\nthe online service, product or feature, or for any processing purpose other\nthan the processing purpose that the controller disclosed at the time the\ncontroller collected the personal data, or that is reasonably necessary for,\nand compatible with, the processing purpose described in this subsection, or\nfor longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service, product\nor feature; or\n\n(2) use any system design feature to significantly increase, sustain or extend\nany minor younger than the age of eighteen's use of such online service,\nproduct or feature. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any\nservice or application that is used by and under the direction of an\neducational entity, including a learning management system or a student\nengagement program.\n\nC. Subject to the consent requirement established in Subsection D of this\nsection, no controller that offers an online service, product or feature to\nconsumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards,\nare minors younger than the age of eighteen shall collect the minor's precise\ngeolocation data unless:\n\n(1) precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller to\nprovide the online service, product or feature and, if the data are necessary\nto provide the online service, product or feature, the controller may only\ncollect the data for the time necessary to provide the online service, product\nor feature; and\n\n(2) the controller provides to the minor a signal indicating that the\ncontroller is collecting the precise geolocation data, which signal shall be\navailable to the minor for the entire duration of such collection.\n\nD. No controller that offers any online service, product or feature to\nconsumers whom the controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards are\nminors younger than the age of eighteen shall engage in the activities\ndescribed in Subsections B and C of this section unless the controller obtains\nthe consent of the minor younger than the age of eighteen, or, if the minor is\nyounger than thirteen years of age, the consent of the minor's parent or legal\nguardian. A controller that complies with the verifiable parental consent\nrequirements established in the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection\nAct of 1998, 1S USC 6501 et seq., and the regulations, rules, guidance and\nexemptions adopted pursuant to that act, as that act and the regulations,\nrules, guidance and exemptions may be amended from time to time, shall be\ndeemed to have satisfied any requirement to obtain parental consent under this\nsubsection.\n\nE. No controller that offers any online service, product or feature to\nconsumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or willfully disregards,\nare minors younger than the age of eighteen shall:\n\n(1) provide any consent mechanism that is designed to substantially subvert or\nimpair, or is manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or\nimpairing, user autonomy, decision-making or choice; or\n\n(2) except as provided in Subsection F of this section, offer any direct\nmessaging apparatus for use by minors without providing readily accessible and\neasy-to-use safeguards to limit the ability of adults to send unsolicited\ncommunications to minors with whom they are not connected.\n\nF. The provisions of Paragraph (2) of Subsection B of this section shall not\napply to services when the predominant or exclusive function is:\n\n(1) electronic mail; or\n\n(2) direct messaging consisting of text, photos or videos that are sent\nbetween devices by electronic means, if messages are:\n\n(a) shared between the sender and the recipient;\n\n(b) only visible to the sender and the recipient; and\n\n(c) not posted publicly.\n\nSECTION 8. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA CONTROLLER RESPONSIBILITIES--ONLINE SERVICE,\nPRODUCT OR FEATURE--DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS, REVIEW AND RECORD KEEPING.--\n\nA. Each controller that, on or after one year after the effective date of the\nConsumer Information and Data Protection Act, offers any online service,\nproduct or feature to consumers whom the controller has actual knowledge, or\nwillfully disregards, are minors younger than the age of eighteen shall\nconduct a data protection assessment for such online service, product or\nfeature:\n\n(1) in a manner that is consistent with the requirements established in\nSection 7 of that act; and\n\n(2) that addresses:\n\n(a) the purpose of the online service, product or feature;\n\n(b) the categories of minors' personal data that the online service, product\nor feature processes;\n\n(c) the purposes for which the controller processes minors' personal data with\nrespect to the online service, product or feature; and\n\n(d) any heightened risk of harm to minors that is a reasonably foreseeable\nresult of offering the online service, product or feature to minors.\n\nB. Each controller that conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to\nSubsection A of this section shall:\n\n(1) review the data protection assessment as necessary to account for any\nmaterial change to the processing operations of the online service, product or\nfeature that is the subject of the data protection assessment; and\n\n(2) maintain documentation concerning the data protection assessment for the\nlonger of:\n\n(a) the three-year period beginning on the date on which the processing\noperations cease; or\n\n(b) as long as the controller offers the online service, product or feature.\n\nC. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of\nprocessing operations that include similar activities.\n\nD. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of\ncomplying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection\nassessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements established in this\nsection if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and\neffect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted\npursuant to this section.\n\nE. If a controller conducts a data protection assessment pursuant to\nSubsection A of this section and determines that the online service, product\nor feature that is the subject of the assessment poses a heightened risk of\nharm to minors, the controller shall establish and implement a plan to\nmitigate or eliminate the risk.\n\nF. Data protection assessments shall be confidential and shall be exempt from\ndisclosure under the Inspection of Public Records Act. To the extent that any\ninformation contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the\nattorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or\nwork product protection, the disclosure shall not constitute a waiver of the\nprivilege or protection.\n\nSECTION 9. [_NEW MATERIAL_] RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTROLLER AND PROCESSOR.--\n\nA. A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall\nassist the controller in meeting its obligations under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act. Such assistance shall include:\n\n(1) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures,\ninsofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's\nobligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to Section 4 of the\nConsumer Information and Data Protection Act;\n\n(2) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's\nobligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in\nrelation to the notification of a breach of security of the system of the\nprocessor pursuant to the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act in\norder to meet the controller's obligations; and\n\n(3) providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and\ndocument data protection assessments pursuant to the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act.\n\nB. A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the\nprocessor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on\nbehalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth\ninstructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the\ntype of data subject to processing, the duration of processing and the rights\nand obligations of both parties. The contract shall also include requirements\nthat the processor shall:\n\n(1) ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of\nconfidentiality with respect to the data;\n\n(2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the\ncontroller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless\nretention of the personal data is required by law;\n\n(3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the\ncontroller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the\nprocessor's compliance with the obligations in the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act;\n\n(4) allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the\ncontroller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for\na qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the\nprocessor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of\nthe obligations under the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act using\nan appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment\nprocedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such\nassessment to the controller upon request; and\n\n(5) engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with\nthis section that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the\nprocessor with respect to the personal data.\n\nC. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a\nprocessor from the liabilities imposed on it by virtue of its role in the\nprocessing relationship as defined by the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act.\n\nD. Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with\nrespect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that\ndepends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed. A\nprocessor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect\nto a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.\n\nSECTION 10. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS.--\n\nA. A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of\neach of the following processing activities involving personal data:\n\n(1) the processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;\n\n(2) the sale of personal data;\n\n(3) the processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where such\nprofiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:\n\n(a) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,\nconsumers;\n\n(b) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers;\n\n(c) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the\nprivate affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would be\noffensive to a reasonable person; or\n\n(d) other substantial injury to consumers;\n\n(4) the processing of sensitive data; and\n\n(5) any processing activities involving personal data that present a\nheightened risk of harm to consumers.\n\nB. Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to Subsection A of this\nsection shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and\nindirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other\nstakeholders and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the\nconsumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can\nbe employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The use of de-identified\ndata and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of\nthe processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer\nwhose personal data will be processed, shall be factored into this assessment\nby the controller.\n\nC. The attorney general may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand,\nthat a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to\nan investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall\nmake the data protection assessment available to the attorney general. The\nattorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance\nwith the responsibilities set forth in Subsection A of this section. Data\nprotection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from public inspection\nand copying under the Inspection of Public Records Act. The disclosure of a\ndata protection assessment pursuant to a request from the attorney general\nshall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product\nprotection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the\nassessment.\n\nD. A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of\nprocessing operations that include similar activities.\n\nE. Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of\ncompliance with other laws or regulations may comply under this section if the\nassessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.\n\nF. Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing\nactivities created or generated after the effective date of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act and are not retroactive.\n\nSECTION 11. [_NEW MATERIAL_] PROCESSING DE-IDENTIFIED DATA.--\n\nA. The controller in possession of de-identified data shall:\n\n(1) take reasonable measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with\na natural person;\n\n(2) publicly commit to maintaining and using de-identified data without\nattempting to re-identify the data; and\n\n(3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de-identified data to comply\nwith all provisions of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.\n\nB. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified\ndata or pseudonymous data or maintain data in identifiable form, or collect,\nobtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of\nassociating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.\n\nC. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated\nconsumer rights request, pursuant to Section 4 of the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act, if all of the following are true:\n\n(1) the controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with\nthe personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to\nassociate the request with the personal data;\n\n(2) the controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to\nthe specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data or associate the\npersonal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and\n\n(3) the controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or\notherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than\na processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.\n\nD. The consumer rights contained in Section 4 of the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases where the\ncontroller is able to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the\nconsumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and\norganizational controls that prevent the controller from accessing such\ninformation.\n\nE. A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified data shall\nexercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual\ncommitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject\nand shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual\ncommitments.\n\nSECTION 12. [_NEW MATERIAL_] LIMITATIONS.--\n\nA. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued to restrict a controller's or processor's ability to:\n\n(1) comply with federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;\n\n(2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory inquiry, investigation,\nsubpoena or summons by federal, state, local or other governmental\nauthorities;\n\n(3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity\nthat the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may\nviolate federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations;\n\n(4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims;\n\n(5) provide a product or service specifically requested by a consumer, perform\na contract to which the consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of\na written warranty, or take steps at the request of the consumer prior to\nentering into a contract;\n\n(6) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life\nor physical safety of the consumer or of another natural person and where the\nprocessing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;\n\n(7) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to security incidents,\nidentity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities or any\nillegal activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or\ninvestigate, report or prosecute those responsible for any such action;\n\n(8) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in\nthe public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy\nlaws and is approved, monitored and governed by an institutional review board\nor similar independent oversight entities that determine:\n\n(a) if the deletion of the information is likely to provide substantial\nbenefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;\n\n(b) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and\n\n(c) if the controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate\nprivacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with\nre-identification; or\n\n(9) assist another controller, processor or third party with any of the\nobligations under this subsection.\n\nB. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act shall not restrict a controller's or\nprocessor's ability to collect, use or retain data to:\n\n(1) conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products, services\nor technology;\n\n(2) effectuate a product recall;\n\n(3) identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended\nfunctionality; or\n\n(4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the\nexpectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's\nexisting relationship with the controller or are otherwise compatible with\nprocessing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service\nspecifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which\nthe consumer is a party.\n\nC. The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act shall not apply where compliance by the\ncontroller or processor with that act would violate an evidentiary privilege\nunder the laws of the state. Nothing in that act shall be construed to prevent\na controller or processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer\nto a person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state as\npart of a privileged communication.\n\nD. A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third-party\ncontroller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, is not in violation of that act if the\nthird-party controller or processor that receives and processes such personal\ndata is in violation of that act; provided that, at the time of disclosing the\npersonal data, the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual\nknowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A third-party\ncontroller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor\nin compliance with the requirements of that act is likewise not in violation\nof that act for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which\nit receives such personal data.\n\nE. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that\nadversely affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising\nthe right of free speech pursuant to the first amendment to the United States\nconstitution, or applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the\ncourse of a purely personal or household activity.\n\nF. Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section shall not\nbe processed for any purpose other than those expressly listed in this section\nunless otherwise allowed by the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act.\nPersonal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be\nprocessed to the extent that such processing is:\n\n(1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this\nsection; and\n\n(2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the\nspecific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or\nretained pursuant to Subsection B of this section shall, where applicable,\ntake into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use\nor retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable administrative,\ntechnical and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and\naccessibility of the personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks\nof harm to consumers relating to such collection, use or retention of personal\ndata.\n\nG. If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this\nsection, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that such processing\nqualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in Subsection F\nof this section.\n\nH. Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in\nSubsection A of this section shall not solely make an entity a controller with\nrespect to such processing.\n\nSECTION 13. [_NEW MATERIAL_] DATA IN THE POSSESSION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.--\n\nA. No person may share, disclose, re-disclose or otherwise disseminate a\ncovered resident's sensitive data in the possession of a federal agency\nwithout the consent of the covered resident, except where that disclosure is\npursuant to a law lawfully enacted by the United States congress.\n\nB. A third party that receives sensitive data from the federal government or\nits agents, without express authorization by a law enacted by the United\nStates congress permitting such disclosure, upon request by the covered\nresident or the attorney general shall:\n\n(1) delete the information in its possession; and\n\n(2) disclose the source from which the information was obtained.\n\nC. A person who receives a request or demand for a covered resident's\nsensitive data in the possession of a federal agency without the consent of\nthe covered resident shall not share, disclose, re-disclose or otherwise\ndisseminate such data without first receiving an order of a court of competent\njurisdiction that such disclosure is pursuant to a law enacted by the United\nStates congress.\n\nD. The attorney general may enforce the provisions of this section and may\nintervene as a matter of right in any action seeking a determination as to\nwhether the requested disclosure is pursuant to a law enacted by the United\nStates congress.\n\nE. The attorney general may enforce the provisions of this section and is\nempowered to issue a civil investigation demand whenever the attorney general\nhas reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged in, is engaging in\nor is about to engage in any violation of this section. A person issued an\ninvestigative demand shall produce the material sought and shall permit it to\nbe copied and inspected by the attorney general. The demand of the attorney\ngeneral and any material produced in response to it shall not be a matter of\npublic record and shall not be published by the attorney general except by\norder of the court.\n\nF. Upon reasonable belief that there has been a violation of this section, the\nattorney general:\n\n(1) may bring an action in the name of the state to enforce the provisions of\nthis section;\n\n(2) may petition the court for injunctive relief; and\n\n(3) shall not be required to post bond when seeking a temporary or permanent\ninjunction.\n\nSECTION 14. [_NEW MATERIAL_] INVESTIGATIVE AUTHORITY.--Whenever the attorney\ngeneral has reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged in, is\nengaging in or is about to engage in any violation of the Consumer Information\nand Data Protection Act, the attorney general is empowered to issue a civil\ninvestigative demand.\n\nSECTION 15. [_NEW MATERIAL_] ENFORCEMENT--CIVIL PENALTIES.--\n\nA. The attorney general shall have authority to enforce the provisions of the\nConsumer Information and Data Protection Act.\n\nB. Prior to initiating any action under the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act other than as specified in Section 13 of that act, the attorney\ngeneral shall provide a controller or processor thirty days' written notice\nidentifying the specific provisions of the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act the attorney general alleges have been or are being violated.\nIf within the thirty-day period the controller or processor cures the noticed\nviolation and provides the attorney general an express written statement that\nthe alleged violations have been cured and that no further violations shall\noccur, no action shall be initiated against the controller or processor.\n\nC. If a controller or processor continues to violate the Consumer Information\nand Data Protection Act following the cure period in Subsection B of this\nsection or breaches an express written statement provided to the attorney\ngeneral under that subsection, the attorney general may initiate an action and\nmay seek an injunction to restrain any violations of that act and civil\npenalties of up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each violation under\nthat act.\n\nD. The attorney general may recover reasonable attorney fees and costs of\ninvestigation and enforcement whenever a court finds a violation of the\nConsumer Information and Data Protection Act.\n\nE. Nothing in the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act shall be\nconstrued as providing the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of\naction for violations of that act or under any other law.\n\nSECTION 16. [_NEW MATERIAL_] SEVERABILITY.--\n\nA. Every provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or word in\nthe Consumer Information and Data Protection Act, and every application of the\nprovisions in that act, are severable from each other.\n\nB. If any application of any provision in the Consumer Information and Data\nProtection Act to any person, group of persons or circumstances is found by a\ncourt to be invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining applications of that\nprovision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and shall\nnot be affected. All constitutionally valid applications of the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act shall be severed from any applications\nthat a court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force,\nbecause it is the legislature's intent and priority that the valid\napplications be allowed to stand alone. Even if a reviewing court finds a\nprovision of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act to impose an\nundue burden in a large or substantial fraction of relevant cases, the\napplications that do not present an undue burden shall be severed from the\nremaining applications, shall remain in force and shall be treated as if the\nlegislature had enacted a statute limited to the persons, group of persons or\ncircumstances for which the statute's application does not present an undue\nburden.\n\nC. If any court declares or finds a provision of the Consumer Information and\nData Protection Act facially unconstitutional, when discrete applications of\nthat provision can be enforced against a person, group of persons or\ncircumstances without violating the United States constitution and the\nconstitution of New Mexico, those applications shall be severed from all\nremaining applications of the provision, and the provision shall be\ninterpreted as if the legislature had enacted a provision limited to the\npersons, group of persons or circumstances for which the provision's\napplication will not violate the United States constitution and the\nconstitution of New Mexico.\n\nD. The legislature further declares that it would have enacted the Consumer\nInformation and Data Protection Act, and each provision, section, subsection,\nsentence, clause, phrase or word, and all constitutional applications of that\nact, regardless of the fact that any provision, section, subsection, sentence,\nclause, phrase or word, or applications of that act, were to be declared\nunconstitutional or to represent an undue burden.\n\nE. If any provision of the Consumer Information and Data Protection Act is\nfound by any court to be unconstitutionally vague, then the applications of\nthat provision that do not present constitutional vagueness problems shall be\nsevered and remain in force.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
