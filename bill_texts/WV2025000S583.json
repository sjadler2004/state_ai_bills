SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX TREATMENT FOR NEW DATA CENTERS AND PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT FOR THE COAL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT SUPPLY THEM.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect; 11-6N-1. Short title.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">This article may be cited as the &quot;West Virginia-Powered Data Center Incentive Act&quot;.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;11-6N-2. Legislative findings and purpose.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) Purpose and Intent. The Legislature of West Virginia finds and declares that the establishment of large data centers within the state is critical to fostering economic growth, technological advancement, and job creation. By providing targeted economic incentives, West Virginia can attract significant private investment, enhance its digital infrastructure, and solidify its position as a competitive player in the global digital economy. These data centers will be reliably supported by West Virginia coal-generated electricity, contributing to grid-stability and industrial growth within the state.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) Economic and Employment Benefits of Data Centers. Data centers represent a cornerstone of the modern economy, providing essential infrastructure to support cloud computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and advanced analytics. The presence of such facilities in West Virginia will:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(1) Generate substantial direct investment in construction and operations, contributing to state and local tax revenues;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) Create high-quality jobs, including skilled technology positions, construction jobs, and support roles in maintenance, security, and administration; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(3) Spur ancillary economic activity by fostering the growth of supply chains, local businesses, and technology-focused educational initiatives.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">The long-term operational presence of data centers will provide stable economic benefits, as these facilities typically operate for decades and require consistent investment in equipment, upgrades, and workforce development.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) Optimization of Coal Production and Employment. Production of electricity utilizing coal produced in West Virginia is now inadequately developed in comparison to nearby states with which West Virginia competes for economically beneficial projects. Coal electric generation projects have been undermined by existing regulatory requirements and related time delays. The Legislature declares that facilitating the development of business activity directly and indirectly related to coal electric generation development, transportation, storage, and use serves the public interest of the citizens of this state by promoting economic development, by improving economic opportunities for the citizens of this state, and providing additional opportunities to stabilize the price of electricity while increasing its reliability and availability.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(d) Infrastructure and Technological Advancement. By attracting large data centers, West Virginia can accelerate the development of state-of-the-art broadband networks and power infrastructure, which are prerequisites for such facilities. These improvements will:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(1) Enhance connectivity for residents and businesses throughout the state.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) Provide critical infrastructure for emerging industries reliant on high-speed Internet and advanced computing capabilities.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(e) Competitive Advantage and Regional Development. Surrounding states have successfully leveraged incentive programs to attract data centers, underscoring the need for West Virginia to adopt competitive measures to attract similar investments. Incentivizing data center development in rural and/or economically distressed areas will promote balanced regional growth, reduce economic disparities, and provide opportunities for workforce training and education in areas historically impacted by declining job opportunities. The state&#39;s geographical advantages, including its proximity to major population centers and relative insulation from natural disasters, make it an ideal location for data center operations. Moreover, the state&#39;s coal-fired electric generating facilities provide affordable, reliable electricity needed to power large-scale data center operations.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(f) Commitment to Strategic Partnerships. The Legislature supports fostering partnerships between data center operators, educational institutions, and workforce development programs to prepare a skilled workforce equipped to meet the demands of the digital economy and create pipelines for local talent to secure high-paying, high-tech jobs within the state.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(g) Conclusion. By enacting targeted economic incentives, such as special property tax treatment for data centers and B&amp;O tax reduction to the electric utilities supplying them, West Virginia can position itself a premiere designation for large-scale data center investment, delivering sustained economic, technological, and societal benefits for its citizens, all while supporting local electricity generators and the coal miners who supply and provide them with the affordable power necessary to thrive in the digital economy. The Legislature commits to pursuing all policies and strategic partnerships that will support these objectives, thereby ensuring a prosperous and innovative future for all West Virginians.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;11-6N-3.

SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX TREATMENT FOR NEW DATA CENTERS AND PROVIDING\nA TAX CREDIT FOR THE COAL-FIRED ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT SUPPLY THEM._\n\n_§ 11-6N-1. Short title._\n\n_This article may be cited as the \"West Virginia-Powered Data Center Incentive\nAct\"._\n\n_§ 11-6N-2. Legislative findings and purpose._\n\n_(a) Purpose and Intent. The Legislature of West Virginia finds and declares\nthat the establishment of large data centers within the state is critical to\nfostering economic growth, technological advancement, and job creation. By\nproviding targeted economic incentives, West Virginia can attract significant\nprivate investment, enhance its digital infrastructure, and solidify its\nposition as a competitive player in the global digital economy. These data\ncenters will be reliably supported by West Virginia coal-generated\nelectricity, contributing to grid-stability and industrial growth within the\nstate._\n\n_(b) Economic and Employment Benefits of Data Centers. Data centers represent\na cornerstone of the modern economy, providing essential infrastructure to\nsupport cloud computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence, and advanced\nanalytics. The presence of such facilities in West Virginia will:_\n\n_(1) Generate substantial direct investment in construction and operations,\ncontributing to state and local tax revenues;_\n\n_(2) Create high-quality jobs, including skilled technology positions,\nconstruction jobs, and support roles in maintenance, security, and\nadministration; and_\n\n_(3) Spur ancillary economic activity by fostering the growth of supply\nchains, local businesses, and technology-focused educational initiatives._\n\n_The long-term operational presence of data centers will provide stable\neconomic benefits, as these facilities typically operate for decades and\nrequire consistent investment in equipment, upgrades, and workforce\ndevelopment._\n\n_(c) Optimization of Coal Production and Employment. Production of electricity\nutilizing coal produced in West Virginia is now inadequately developed in\ncomparison to nearby states with which West Virginia competes for economically\nbeneficial projects. Coal electric generation projects have been undermined by\nexisting regulatory requirements and related time delays. The Legislature\ndeclares that facilitating the development of business activity directly and\nindirectly related to coal electric generation development, transportation,\nstorage, and use serves the public interest of the citizens of this state by\npromoting economic development, by improving economic opportunities for the\ncitizens of this state, and providing additional opportunities to stabilize\nthe price of electricity while increasing its reliability and availability._\n\n_(d) Infrastructure and Technological Advancement. By attracting large data\ncenters, West Virginia can accelerate the development of state-of-the-art\nbroadband networks and power infrastructure, which are prerequisites for such\nfacilities. These improvements will:_\n\n_(1) Enhance connectivity for residents and businesses throughout the state._\n\n_(2) Provide critical infrastructure for emerging industries reliant on high-\nspeed Internet and advanced computing capabilities._\n\n_(e) Competitive Advantage and Regional Development. Surrounding states have\nsuccessfully leveraged incentive programs to attract data centers,\nunderscoring the need for West Virginia to adopt competitive measures to\nattract similar investments. Incentivizing data center development in rural\nand/or economically distressed areas will promote balanced regional growth,\nreduce economic disparities, and provide opportunities for workforce training\nand education in areas historically impacted by declining job opportunities.\nThe state 's geographical advantages, including its proximity to major\npopulation centers and relative insulation from natural disasters, make it an\nideal location for data center operations. Moreover, the state's coal-fired\nelectric generating facilities provide affordable, reliable electricity needed\nto power large-scale data center operations._\n\n_(f) Commitment to Strategic Partnerships. The Legislature supports fostering\npartnerships between data center operators, educational institutions, and\nworkforce development programs to prepare a skilled workforce equipped to meet\nthe demands of the digital economy and create pipelines for local talent to\nsecure high-paying, high-tech jobs within the state._\n\n_(g) Conclusion. By enacting targeted economic incentives, such as special\nproperty tax treatment for data centers and B &O tax reduction to the electric\nutilities supplying them, West Virginia can position itself a premiere\ndesignation for large-scale data center investment, delivering sustained\neconomic, technological, and societal benefits for its citizens, all while\nsupporting local electricity generators and the coal miners who supply and\nprovide them with the affordable power necessary to thrive in the digital\neconomy. The Legislature commits to pursuing all policies and strategic\npartnerships that will support these objectives, thereby ensuring a prosperous\nand innovative future for all West Virginians._\n\n_§ 11-6N-3.
