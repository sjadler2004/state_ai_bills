This act shall take effect on the first day of the third month next following enactment, except that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General may take such anticipatory action as may be necessary for the timely implementation of this act. </p>\n   </effective_clause>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"digest_document_section\"></a><div class=\"digest\">\n   <p class=\"center\">STATEMENT</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> This bill establishes a person&#39;s right of publicity as a property right in the New Jersey Statutes. The right of publicity is commonly defined as the right to prevent unauthorized commercial use of a person&#39;s name, image, likeness, or voice. In this State, the right of publicity has long been recognized and developed through case law by the courts since <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Edison v. Edison Polyform and Mfg. Co.</u>, 73 <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">N.J. Eq.</u> 136 (Ct. Chancery 1907), but has never been codified in the statutes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Under the bill, every individual has an exclusive property right in the use of that individual&#39;s name, image, likeness, or voice in any medium in any manner, which may be assigned, licensed, or inherited by the individual&#39;s executors, assignees, heirs, or devisees. A deceased individual&#39;s executors, assignees, heirs, or devisees retain the individual&#39;s exclusive right of publicity for ten years following death, which may be extended in perpetuity if that right is commercially exploited, or which may be terminated after two years for non-use following the initial ten year period. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> A person who knowingly infringes on an individual&#39;s right of publicity, including infringement through the use of artificial intelligence technology, shall be liable in a civil action and shall also be guilty of a disorderly person offense. A disorderly person offense is punishable by imprisonment for up to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. In addition, court may order an award of monetary damages as well as injunctive relief such as the forfeiture, seizure, or destruction of any infringing items.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill sets forth fair use exceptions for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, research, or other uses consistent with the federal Copyright Act of 1976 and the federal Lanham Act. The bill is intended to not affect any existing licensing or publicity contracts, or service marks, trademarks, or trade names, properly made or registered as of the effective date of the bill. The bill is also intended to not affect any existing civil tort laws concerning defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, false light, misappropriation of identity, intrusion of privacy, public disclosure of private facts, unlawful interference with prospective economic advantage, or tortious interference with contractual relations, or any existing criminal laws concerning identity theft, music piracy, or counterfeiting. The bill is also not intended to limit the rights of student-athletes under the New Jersey Fair Play Act.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

The right of publicity is commonly defined as the right\nto prevent unauthorized commercial use of a person's name, image, likeness, or\nvoice. In this State, the right of publicity has long been recognized and\ndeveloped through case law by the courts since _Edison v. Edison Polyform and\nMfg. Co._ , 73 _N.J. Eq._ 136 (Ct. Chancery 1907), but has never been codified\nin the statutes.\n\nUnder the bill, every individual has an exclusive property right in the use of\nthat individual's name, image, likeness, or voice in any medium in any manner,\nwhich may be assigned, licensed, or inherited by the individual's executors,\nassignees, heirs, or devisees. A deceased individual's executors, assignees,\nheirs, or devisees retain the individual's exclusive right of publicity for\nten years following death, which may be extended in perpetuity if that right\nis commercially exploited, or which may be terminated after two years for non-\nuse following the initial ten year period.\n\nA person who knowingly infringes on an individual's right of publicity,\nincluding infringement through the use of artificial intelligence technology,\nshall be liable in a civil action and shall also be guilty of a disorderly\nperson offense. A disorderly person offense is punishable by imprisonment for\nup to six months, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. In addition, court may\norder an award of monetary damages as well as injunctive relief such as the\nforfeiture, seizure, or destruction of any infringing items.\n\nThe bill sets forth fair use exceptions for criticism, comment, news\nreporting, teaching, scholarship, research, or other uses consistent with the\nfederal Copyright Act of 1976 and the federal Lanham Act. The bill is intended\nto not affect any existing licensing or publicity contracts, or service marks,\ntrademarks, or trade names, properly made or registered as of the effective\ndate of the bill. The bill is also intended to not affect any existing civil\ntort laws concerning defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy, false\nlight, misappropriation of identity, intrusion of privacy, public disclosure\nof private facts, unlawful interference with prospective economic advantage,\nor tortious interference with contractual relations, or any existing criminal\nlaws concerning identity theft, music piracy, or counterfeiting. The bill is\nalso not intended to limit the rights of student-athletes under the New Jersey\nFair Play Act.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
