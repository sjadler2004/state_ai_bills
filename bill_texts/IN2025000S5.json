The provisions relating to the allotment system shall not apply to money made available for the purpose of conducting a post-audit of financial transactions of any state agency. Likewise, appropriations for construction or for the acquisition of real estate for public purposes may be exempted from the allotment system by the budget director. The budget director shall prescribe regulations as will ensure the proper application and encumbering of those funds.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) No appropriation to any state agency shall become available for expenditure until:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the state agency shall have submitted to the budget agency a request for allotment, the request for allotment to consist of an estimate of the amount required for each activity and each purpose for which money is to be expended during the applicable allotment period; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the estimate contained in the request for allotment shall have been approved, increased, or decreased by the budget director and funds allotted as provided.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The form of a request for allotment, including a request by hand, mail, facsimile transmission, or other electronic transmission, shall be prescribed by the budget agency with the approval of the state comptroller and shall be submitted to them at least twenty-five (25) days prior to the beginning of the allotment period.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Each request for allotment shall be reviewed by the budget agency and respective amounts shall be allotted for expenditure if:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) the estimate is within the terms of the appropriation as to amount and purpose, having due regard for the probable future needs of the state agency for the remainder of the fiscal year or other term for which the appropriation was made; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) the agency contemplates expenditure of the allotment during the period.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Otherwise the budget agency shall modify the estimate to conform with the terms of the appropriation and the prospective needs of the state agency, and shall reduce the amount to be allotted accordingly.
