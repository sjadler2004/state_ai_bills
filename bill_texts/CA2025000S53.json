CalCompute: foundation models: whistleblowers.\n\n(1) Existing law establishes the Department of Technology within the\nGovernment Operations Agency. Existing law requires the department to conduct,\nin coordination with other interagency bodies as it deems appropriate, a\ncomprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated decision systems that have\nbeen proposed for use, development, or procurement by, or are being used,\ndeveloped, or procured by, any state agency.\n\nThis bill would establish within the Government Operations Agency a consortium\nrequired to develop a framework for the creation of a public cloud computing\ncluster to be known as \"CalCompute\" that advances the development and\ndeployment of artificial intelligence that is safe, ethical, equitable, and\nsustainable by, among other things, fostering research and innovation that\nbenefits the public, as prescribed. The bill would require the Government\nOperations Agency to, on or before January 1, 2027, submit a report from the\nconsortium to the Legislature with that~~framework.~~ _framework, and would\ndissolve the consortium upon submission of that report._ The bill would make\nthose provisions operative only upon an appropriation in a budget act, or\nother measure, for its purposes.\n\n(2) Existing law prohibits employers and their agents from making, adopting,\nor enforcing a rule, regulation, or policy preventing an employee from\ndisclosing information to certain entities or from providing information to,\nor testifying before, any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or\ninquiry if the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information\ndiscloses a violation of a law, as specified, and prohibits retaliation\nagainst an employee for, among other things, exercising these rights.\n\nThis bill would, among other things related to protecting whistleblowers\nworking with certain artificial intelligence models, prohibit a developer from\nmaking, adopting, or enforcing a rule, regulation, or policy that prevents an\nemployee from disclosing, or retaliates against an employee for disclosing,\ninformation to the Attorney General, federal authorities, or another employee\nwho has authority to investigate, discover, or correct the reported issue, if\nthe employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses\nthat the developer's activities pose a critical risk or that the developer has\nmade false or misleading statements about its management of critical risk. The\nbill would define \"critical risk\" to mean a foreseeable and material risk that\na developer's development, storage, or deployment of a foundation model, as\ndefined, will result in the death of, or serious injury to, more than 100\npeople, or more than $1 billion in damage to rights in money or property, as\nprovided. The bill would also require a developer to provide a certain\ninternal process through which an employee may anonymously disclose\ninformation to the developer if the employee believes in good faith that the\ninformation indicates that the developer's activities present a critical risk,\nas prescribed. The bill would specify provisions particular to enforcement and\nwould authorize attorney's fees to a plaintiff who brings a successful action\nfor a violation.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.
