This legislature hereby finds that this generation of humans is the first in history to have the ability to create technologies that can make decisions which previously could have only been made by humans. States and countries across the world are grappling with critical questions of how we can use these technologies to solve our problems, how we can avoid or manage the new problems that these technologies may create, and how we can control these powerful technologies. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, the legislature declares that any New York resident affected by any system making decisions without human intervention be entitled to certain rights and protections to ensure that the system impacting their lives do so lawfully, properly, and with meaningful oversight. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Among these rights and protections are (i) the right to safe and effective systems; (ii) protections against algorithmic discrimination; (iii) protections against abusive data practices; (iv) the right to have agency over one&#39;s data; (v) the right to know when an automated system is being used; (vi) the right to understand how and why an automated system contributed to outcomes that impact one; (vii) the right to opt out of an automated system; and (viii) the right to work with a human in the place of an automated system. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds that automated systems will continue to be developed and evolve both within the state and outside the state. It is therefore critical that New York does not overburden the development of innovative systems that better the state and its residents, nor drive the development of such systems to foreign states or countries with less appropriate regulation, nor threaten the security of our state, country, and its people. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">To these ends, the legislature declares that the white paper published by the White House Office of Science and Technology titled &quot;Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights&quot; in October of 2022 is commensurate with the goals of this state in relation to artificial intelligence. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.
