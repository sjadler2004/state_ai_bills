The legislature finds that artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly transforming industries and societies worldwide by enabling computers and machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving, decision making, creativity, and autonomy. Therefore, establishing an artificial intelligence institute in Hawaii will:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Promote research and innovation in artificial intelligence tailored to Hawaii&#39;s unique cultural, economic, and environmental needs;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Advance workforce development and education to prepare residents for the artificial intelligence-driven future;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Foster public-private partnerships to leverage resources and drive economic growth;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Ensure that artificial intelligence development aligns with ethical principles and benefits for all residents of Hawaii; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Provide access to advanced computing infrastructure, artificial intelligence and data science expertise, immersive visualization technologies, and collaborative workspaces to support research, education, and creative projects.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature further finds that as the sole institution of public higher education in the State, the university of Hawaii has the unique capacity to draw upon its academic disciplines, research strengths, and professional programs to serve as the hub for Hawaii artificial intelligence development in areas such as renewable energy, climate resilience, space sciences and engineering, health, sustainable agriculture, additive manufacturing, creative media, and cultural preservation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The legislature also finds that activities of the artificial intelligence institute could take place, in part, at the several campuses and academic and professional programs across the university of Hawaii system. In turn, faculty associated with the artificial intelligence institute could actively contribute to its vision by participating in interdisciplinary research, community engagement, and student mentoring and securing grants that align with the institute&#39;s mission and the State&#39;s economic roadmap. Through this mutual commitment, the artificial intelligence institute could serve as a model of excellence for regional, place-based innovation, workforce development, knowledge creation, cultural enrichment, and social good to serve Hawaii and the nation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, due to artificial intelligence&#39;s importance to the State, funding an institute dedicated to research, governance and ethics, development, and applications of artificial intelligence and related technologies is in the public interest and a matter of statewide concern.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The purpose of this Act is to establish and appropriate funds for an artificial intelligence institute within the university of Hawaii to develop, support, and advance artificial intelligence initiatives statewide.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 2.

The legislature finds that artificial intelligence technologies are\nrapidly transforming industries and societies worldwide by enabling computers\nand machines to simulate human learning, comprehension, problem solving,\ndecision making, creativity, and autonomy. Therefore, establishing an\nartificial intelligence institute in Hawaii will:\n\n(1) Promote research and innovation in artificial intelligence tailored to\nHawaii's unique cultural, economic, and environmental needs;\n\n(2) Advance workforce development and education to prepare residents for the\nartificial intelligence-driven future;\n\n(3) Foster public-private partnerships to leverage resources and drive\neconomic growth;\n\n(4) Ensure that artificial intelligence development aligns with ethical\nprinciples and benefits for all residents of Hawaii; and\n\n(5) Provide access to advanced computing infrastructure, artificial\nintelligence and data science expertise, immersive visualization technologies,\nand collaborative workspaces to support research, education, and creative\nprojects.\n\nThe legislature further finds that as the sole institution of public higher\neducation in the State, the university of Hawaii has the unique capacity to\ndraw upon its academic disciplines, research strengths, and professional\nprograms to serve as the hub for Hawaii artificial intelligence development in\nareas such as renewable energy, climate resilience, space sciences and\nengineering, health, sustainable agriculture, additive manufacturing, creative\nmedia, and cultural preservation.\n\nThe legislature also finds that activities of the artificial intelligence\ninstitute could take place, in part, at the several campuses and academic and\nprofessional programs across the university of Hawaii system. In turn, faculty\nassociated with the artificial intelligence institute could actively\ncontribute to its vision by participating in interdisciplinary research,\ncommunity engagement, and student mentoring and securing grants that align\nwith the institute's mission and the State's economic roadmap. Through this\nmutual commitment, the artificial intelligence institute could serve as a\nmodel of excellence for regional, place-based innovation, workforce\ndevelopment, knowledge creation, cultural enrichment, and social good to serve\nHawaii and the nation.\n\nAdditionally, due to artificial intelligence's importance to the State,\nfunding an institute dedicated to research, governance and ethics,\ndevelopment, and applications of artificial intelligence and related\ntechnologies is in the public interest and a matter of statewide concern.\n\nThe purpose of this Act is to establish and appropriate funds for an\nartificial intelligence institute within the university of Hawaii to develop,\nsupport, and advance artificial intelligence initiatives statewide.\n\nSECTION 2.
