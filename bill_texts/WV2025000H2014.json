Legislative findings and purpose</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation. </u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(3) The People&rsquo;s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(4) It is in the United States&rsquo; national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States. The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States &quot;to sustain and enhance America&rsquo;s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security.&quot; Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located across the West Virginia border in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation&rsquo;s critical data infrastructure.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation&rsquo;s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth. The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth. Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the Legislature&rsquo;s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">&sect;11-6N-2.

Some data center developers now seek or require the use of\nmicrogrids to provide their primary and backup power._\n\n_(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the\nUnited States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to\nWashington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the\nmajority of the Nation 's population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the\nleast restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of\nabundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) its\nskilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the\nNation._\n\n_As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development\nand expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic\ngrowth. The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local\nborders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional\neconomic growth. It is in the best interest of the state to induce and assist\nin development of these projects, in order to advance the public purposes of\nrelieving unemployment by preserving and creating jobs, and preserving and\ncreating new and greater sources of revenues for the support of public\nservices provided by the state and local government. Additionally, the\nprovisions in this section align with the Legislature 's goal of fostering a\ncompetitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents._\n\n_It is the intent of the Legislature to occupy the whole field of the creation\nand regulation of certified microgrid districts and certified high impact data\ncenters.

Factors to be considered\nby the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (i) current capacity factors; (ii) management of existing\nfuel supplies and contracts; (iii) overall plant operation and maintenance;\n(iv) placement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor's\nday-ahead and real-time energy markets; (v) utilization of the PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM); and\n(vi) the utilization of automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel\nadjustment clauses by the utilities. For purposes of this section, \"consumer\neconomic dispatch\" shall mean the process of operating generation facilities\nto produce electricity at the lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer\ndemand, considering the operational limits of generation and transmission\nfacilities._\n\n_(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of\nelectricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result\nin reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers. The commission shall\nrequire the utilities to maintain their generating units and fuel inventories\nin a manner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a\nsixty-nine percent capacity factor. Nothing herein shall require a utility to\noperate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will\ncause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above\nthe established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or\nschedule. By July 1, 2025, the commission shall promulgate rules as necessary\nto carry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein._\n\n§24-2-1q. Base fuel supply requirements for electric grid resiliency.\n\nAny coal-fired power plant owned by a public electric utility as of the\neffective date of this section shall, in order to ensure grid resiliency and\nhomeland security, maintain a minimum _45_ ~~30~~ -day aggregate coal supply\n_on site at the power plant_ ~~under contract~~ for the remainder of the life\nof those plants.\n\n§24-2-15. _Certain_ ~~automatic~~ _Automatic_ adjustment clauses _, price\nindexes_ or fuel adjustment clauses prohibited.\n\nThe commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or\notherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll or schedule _as the result of_ ~~through~~ any\nautomatic adjustment clause _, price index_ or fuel adjustment clause.\n_Automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses that\ndo not create a net increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over\nand above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge,\ntoll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission. For purposes of this\nsection, a \"net increase\" in the charge or charges for electric service shall\nmean that for the calendar year in which the automatic adjustment clause,\nprice index, or fuel adjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or\ncharges for electric energy are higher than they would have been if the\nadjustment clause, price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized.\nThe commission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment\nclauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing\nthe generation of coal-fired power plants within the state. No later than July\n1, 2025, the Commission shall promulgate procedural rules governing the\nutilization of automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes, and fuel\nadjustment clauses._\n\n§24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required.\n\n(a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue\nan order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing\nrequirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the\nfuture review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an\ninitial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016,\nin conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or\nentities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for\ndeveloping an integrated resource plan.\n\n(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the\nPublic Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply\nside and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource\nplan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied.\nThereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource\nplan pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.\n\n(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan\nshall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial\nintegrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt\nfrom filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated\nresource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at\nleast every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply\nwith the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission\nestablishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised\nintegrated resource plans.\n\n(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated\nresource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information\nfrom the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the\nobligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.\n\n(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources\nwhen developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan\nshall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity\nresources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a\nreasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in\nmeeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to\nits electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.\n\n_(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025,\nrequire all electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their\nexisting integrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and\nmaintenance plan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for\nensuring the operation of each generating unit through the end of 2040. The\nsupplemental integrated resource plan shall also include an analysis of the\naction necessary to extend the life of each generating unit beyond their\nplanned retirement date in lieu of the construction of new generation assets.\nThe commission may approve the supplemental integrated resource plan without\nmodification or require modification of the supplemental plan before it is\napproved. No later than July 1, 2025, the commission shall promulgate rules\nrequiring the supplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this\nprovision. The rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an\nindependent evaluation of any modification required by the commission\nhereunder or to challenge such required modification._\n\nNOTE: The purpose of this bill is to establish the Certified Microgrid Program\nadministered by the Division of Economic Development.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

TAXATION.\n\n_ARTICLE 6N. SPECIAL METHOD FOR VALUATION OF CERTAIN HIGH-TECHNOLOGY PROPERTY_\n\n_§ 11-6N-1. Legislative findings and purpose_\n\n_The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:_\n\n_(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy,\ngenerating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure\ninvestments, and technological innovation._\n\n_(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant,\nlow-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation\nassets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy._\n\n_(3) The People 's Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global\nleader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of\ndata toward China instead of toward the United States._\n\n_(4) It is in the United States ' national security interests to limit the\nflow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize\ncomputational power inside the United States. The President has declared that\nit is the policy of the United States \"to sustain and enhance America's global\nAI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness\nand national security.\" Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial\nIntelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025)._\n\n_(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational\npower and data centers in the world is located across the West Virginia border\nin Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one\nlocation is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential\nfor cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation 's critical data\ninfrastructure._\n\n_(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the\nelectric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of\nmicrogrids to provide their primary and backup power._\n\n_(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the\nUnited States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to\nWashington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the\nmajority of the Nation 's population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the\nleast restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of\nabundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a\nskilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the\nNation._\n\n_As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development\nand expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic\ngrowth. The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders,\nincluding environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic\ngrowth. Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the\nLegislature 's goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that\nbenefits all residents._\n\n_§ 11-6N-2.

Factors to be considered\nby the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (1) current capacity factors; (2) management of fuel\nsupplies and contracts; (3) overall plant operation and maintenance; (4)\nplacement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor's day-\nahead and real-time energy markets; (5) utilization of the PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) or\nFixed Resource Requirement (FRR); and (6) the utilization of automatic\nadjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses by the\nutilities. For purposes of this section, \"consumer economic dispatch\" shall\nmean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at\nthe lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the\noperational limits of generation and transmission facilities._\n\n_(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of\nelectricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result\nin reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers. The commission shall\nrequire the utilities to maintain their generating units in a manner to allow\nthem to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-nine percent\ncapacity factor. Nothing herein shall require a utility to operate a\ngenerating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will cause an\nincrease in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the\nestablished and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or schedule.\nThe commission shall promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and\nobligations as set forth herein._\n\n§24-2-1q. Base fuel _coal_ supply requirements for electric grid resiliency.\n\n_Recognizing that coal inventories at coal-fired power plants may increase and\ndecrease over time_ ~~Any coal-fired power plant owned by a public electric\nutility as of the effective date of this section shall~~ , in order to ensure\ngrid resiliency and homeland security, _each generating public utility shall\nplan incoming and outgoing coal so as to_ maintain a _n average annual_\nminimum 30-day aggregate coal supply _on site at each coal-fired power plant_\n~~under contract for the remainder of the life of those plants~~. _The\ncommission may promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and\nobligations as set forth herein._\n\n§24-2-15. _Certain_ ~~automatic~~ _Automatic_ adjustment clauses _, price\nindexes_ or fuel adjustment ~~clauses prohibited~~.\n\nThe commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or\notherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll or schedule _as the result of_ ~~through~~ any\nautomatic adjustment clause _, fuel supply price index_ or fuel adjustment\nclause. _Automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or\nfuel adjustment clauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or\ncharges for electric energy over and above the established and published\ntariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the\ncommission. For purposes of this section, a \"net increase\" in the charge or\ncharges for electric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which\nthe automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel\nadjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or charges for electric\nenergy are higher than they would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel\nsupply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized. The\ncommission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses,\nfuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of\nincreasing the generation of coal-fired power plants within the state. The\nCommission shall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of\nautomatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel\nadjustment clauses._\n\n§24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required.\n\n(a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue\nan order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing\nrequirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the\nfuture review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an\ninitial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016,\nin conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or\nentities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for\ndeveloping an integrated resource plan.\n\n(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the\nPublic Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply\nside and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource\nplan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied.\nThereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource\nplan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.\n\n(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan\nshall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial\nintegrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt\nfrom filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated\nresource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at\nleast every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply\nwith the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission\nestablishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised\nintegrated resource plans.\n\n(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated\nresource plan.

TAXATION.\n\n_ARTICLE 6N. SPECIAL METHOD FOR VALUATION OF CERTAIN HIGH-TECHNOLOGY\nPROPERTY._\n\n_§ 11-6N-1. Legislative findings and purpose._\n\n_The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:_\n\n_(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy,\ngenerating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure\ninvestments, and technological innovation._\n\n_(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant,\nlow-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation\nassets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy._\n\n_(3) The People 's Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global\nleader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of\ndata toward China instead of toward the United States._\n\n_(4) It is in the United States ' national security interests to limit the\nflow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize\ncomputational power inside the United States. The President has declared that\nit is the policy of the United States \"to sustain and enhance America's global\nAI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness\nand national security.\" Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial\nIntelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025)._\n\n_(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational\npower and data centers in the world is located across the West Virginia border\nin Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one\nlocation is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential\nfor cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation 's critical data\ninfrastructure._\n\n_(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the\nelectric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of\nmicrogrids to provide their primary and backup power._\n\n_(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the\nUnited States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to\nWashington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the\nmajority of the Nation 's population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the\nleast restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of\nabundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; and (F) a\nskilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the\nNation._\n\n_As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development\nand expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic\ngrowth. The Legislature find that these externalities transcend local borders,\nincluding environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic\ngrowth. Additionally, the provisions in this article aligns with the\nLegislature 's goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that\nbenefits all residents._\n\n_§ 11-6N-2.

Future electric generating capacity requirements.\n\n(a) In order to maximize the use of electricity generated within the state by\nusing coal or natural gas produced within the state, the Public Service\nCommission shall by order, no later than December 31, 1989, establish the\nschedule and amount of future electric generating capacity additions required\nby each West Virginia electric utility, for the next ten years, taking into\naccount: (1) Projected load growth; (2) existing generating capacity; (3)\n_capacity factors for existing generation; (4)_ existing contractual\ncommitments to sell or purchase capacity; (~~5~~) planned retirement and life\nextensions of existing capacity; (6) planned construction of capacity; (7)\navailability of capacity from generating units of affiliated companies; and\n(8) such other reasonable factors as the commission may deem relevant and\nappropriate to consider. _For purposes of this section, \"capacity factor\"\nshall mean the ratio of the actual energy produced by a power plant over a\nspecific period to the maximum possible energy it could have produced if\nrunning at full capacity during that same period._\n\n(b) If the commission determines after considering all such named and other\nrelevant and appropriate factors that a utility will be required to purchase\nelectric generating capacity beyond those agreements approved by the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission or the West Virginia Public Service Commission in\norder to serve its West Virginia customers, the amount of such required\nadditional purchased capacity so identified by the commission will for\npurposes of this section be referred to as the utility's \"projected deficient\ncapacity\": Provided, That this subsection shall not include power generating\nfacilities whose total production of electricity is sold outside the State of\nWest Virginia.\n\n(c) In the interests of: Keeping utility rates of residential customers as low\nas possible; keeping utility rates for commercial and industrial customers\ncompetitive with those of other states; attracting new industry for which\nelectric power costs are a major factor in location determinations; and of not\nplacing any greater cost burden on government than is absolutely necessary for\nits electric power needs, each utility shall acquire, if reasonable, its\nprojected deficient capacity from electric generation situated in West\nVirginia which burns coal or gas produced in West Virginia and which will\nprovide the most reliable supply of capacity and energy at the least cost to\nthose customers of the utility who will be served by such electric generation:\nProvided, That all power purchase contracts executed prior to the effective\ndate of this section which satisfy the following requirements, regardless of\nlocation, shall be considered, for the purposes of this subsection, as\nelectric generation situated in West Virginia: (1) Said contracts were\nnegotiated in accordance with procedures and priced according to methodologies\nof other contracts which the commission has ordered approved; (2) said\ncontracts either guarantee or are substantially amended to guarantee for the\nlife of the contract the use of an amount of West Virginia fuel which equals\nor exceeds the amount which would be required, on a percentage of output\nbasis, to produce the amount of electric power to be consumed in West\nVirginia; and (3) said contracts meet the requirements for a qualifying\nfacility established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to\nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.\n\n_(d) The commission shall evaluate each capacity auction conducted by PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor and, to the maximum extent permitted by\nlaw, encourage the coordination of the voluntary participation of every\nelectric generating unit in the state in each capacity auction for the benefit\nof ratepayers in the state._\n\n_(e) In order to ensure the state 's existing generating units can continue to\nmeet future generation needs, the commission shall conduct a review of each\ngenerating unit's current consumer economic dispatch. Factors to be considered\nby the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (1) current capacity factors; (2) management of fuel\nsupplies and contracts; (3) overall plant operation and maintenance; (4)\nplacement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor's day-\nahead and real-time energy markets; (5) utilization of the PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) or\nFixed Resource Requirement (FRR); and (6) the utilization of automatic\nadjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses by the\nutilities. For purposes of this section, \"consumer economic dispatch\" shall\nmean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at\nthe lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the\noperational limits of generation and transmission facilities._\n\n_(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of\nelectricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result\nin reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers. The commission shall\nrequire the utilities to maintain their thermal baseload generating units in a\nmanner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-\nnine percent capacity factor. Nothing herein shall require a utility to\noperate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will\ncause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above\nthe established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or\nschedule. The commission shall promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its\nduties and obligations as set forth herein._\n\n§24-2-1q. Base fuel _coal_ supply requirements for electric grid resiliency.\n\n_Recognizing that coal inventories at coal-fired power plants may increase and\ndecrease over time_ ~~Any coal-fired power plant owned by a public electric\nutility as of the effective date of this section shall~~ , in order to ensure\ngrid resiliency and homeland security, _each generating public utility shall\nplan incoming and outgoing coal so as to_ maintain a _n average annual_\nminimum 30-day aggregate coal supply _on site at each coal-fired power plant_\n~~under contract for the remainder of the life of those plants~~. _The\ncommission may promulgate rules as necessary to carry out its duties and\nobligations as set forth herein._\n\n§24-2-15. _Certain_ ~~automatic~~ _Automatic_ adjustment clauses _, price\nindexes_ or fuel adjustment ~~clauses prohibited~~.\n\nThe commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or\notherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll or schedule _as the result of_ ~~through~~ any\nautomatic adjustment clause _, fuel supply price index_ or fuel adjustment\nclause. _Automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or\nfuel adjustment clauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or\ncharges for electric energy over and above the established and published\ntariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the\ncommission. For purposes of this section, a \"net increase\" in the charge or\ncharges for electric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which\nthe automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel\nadjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or charges for electric\nenergy are higher than they would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel\nsupply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized. The\ncommission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses,\nfuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of\nincreasing the generation of coal-fired power plants within the state. The\nCommission shall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of\nautomatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel\nadjustment clauses._\n\n§24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required.\n\n(a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue\nan order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing\nrequirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the\nfuture review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an\ninitial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016,\nin conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or\nentities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for\ndeveloping an integrated resource plan.\n\n(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the\nPublic Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply\nside and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource\nplan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied.\nThereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource\nplan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.\n\n(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan\nshall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial\nintegrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt\nfrom filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated\nresource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at\nleast every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply\nwith the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission\nestablishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised\nintegrated resource plans.\n\n(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated\nresource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information\nfrom the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the\nobligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.\n\n(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources\nwhen developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan\nshall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity\nresources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a\nreasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in\nmeeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to\nits electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.\n\n_(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025,\nrequire all electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their\nexisting integrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and\nmaintenance plan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for\nensuring the operation of each generating unit through their planned\nretirement date. The supplemental integrated resource plan shall also include\nan analysis of the action necessary to extend the life of each generating unit\nbeyond their planned retirement date. Subject to notice and comment from\ninterested parties, the commission may approve the supplemental integrated\nresource plan without modification or require modification of the supplemental\nplan before it is approved. The commission shall promulgate rules requiring\nthe supplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this\nprovision. The rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an\nindependent evaluation of any modification required by the commission\nhereunder or to challenge such required modification._\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

Data Centers.</b>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Findings and purpose. &mdash; The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) The People&rsquo;s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) It is in the United States&rsquo; national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States. The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States &quot;to sustain and enhance America&rsquo;s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security.&quot; Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation&rsquo;s critical data infrastructure.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation&rsquo;s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; (F) its supply of resources, such as coal mine methane blended with natural gas, to assist data centers locating in West Virginia to meet their energy needs and environmental goals; and (G) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth. The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth. Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the Legislature&rsquo;s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Program established. &mdash; The High Impact Data Center Program is hereby created and is to be administered as a program within the Division of Economic Development to encourage the continued development, construction, operation, maintenance, and expansion in West Virginia of high impact data centers. In order to effectuate the purposes of this section, the Division of Economic Development, or any agency, division, or subdivision thereof, may promulgate legislative rules, including emergency rules, in accordance with &sect;29A-3-1 et seq. of this code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Notification. &mdash; Any data center shall compare its current or planned operations against the definition of &quot;high impact data center&quot; established in &sect;11-6N-2 of this code and provide notification to the Division of Economic Development when the data center becomes aware that it will satisfy or has satisfied that definition. The notification will include information addressing the elements of that definition, including known or expected power consumption of the data center. This notification shall be made (1) within 30 days after the data center determines that it meets these requirements, or (2) when the data center reasonably anticipates that it will, at some future date, meet these requirements, in which case the data center may provide that anticipated future date in its notification.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Certification. &mdash; The Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall identify and certify high impact data centers in this state upon a finding that a data center satisfies the requirements for the definition of &quot;high impact data center&quot; set forth in &sect;11-6N-2 of this code. The Secretary shall issue confirmation of certification to a high impact data center within 14 days following receipt of the notification from the data center required by this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Recordkeeping. &mdash; Any information provided by a data center pursuant to this section that is identified by the data center as confidential business information shall be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The Secretary shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall maintain a complete list of all certified high impact data centers and all relevant information that can be made available to the Governor and Legislature, removing specifically identifying information to ensure confidentiality of any such information as identified by any high impact data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>&sect;5B-2-21b.

Automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission. For purposes of this section, a &quot;net increase&quot; in the charge or charges for electric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which the automatic adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause is utilized, the average charge or charges for electric energy are higher than they would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized. The commission shall encourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing the generation of coal-fired power plants within the state.

Data Centers.**\n\n(a) Findings and purpose. -- The Legislature hereby finds and declares the\nfollowing:\n\n(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy,\ngenerating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure\ninvestments, and technological innovation.\n\n(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant,\nlow-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation\nassets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.\n\n(3) The People's Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global\nleader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of\ndata toward China instead of toward the United States.\n\n(4) It is in the United States' national security interests to limit the flow\nof data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational\npower inside the United States. The President has declared that it is the\npolicy of the United States \"to sustain and enhance America's global AI\ndominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and\nnational security.\" Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial\nIntelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).\n\n(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational\npower and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nThis severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national\nsecurity vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and\nespionage against the Nation's critical data infrastructure.\n\n(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the\nelectric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of\nmicrogrids to provide their primary and backup power.\n\n(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the\nUnited States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to\nWashington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the\nmajority of the Nation's population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the\nleast restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of\nabundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; (F) its\nsupply of resources, such as coal mine methane blended with natural gas, to\nassist data centers locating in West Virginia to meet their energy needs and\nenvironmental goals; and (G) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of\nthe lowest turnover rates in the Nation.\n\nAs such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development\nand expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic\ngrowth. The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local\nborders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional\neconomic growth. Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the\nLegislature's goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that\nbenefits all residents.\n\n(b) Program established. -- The High Impact Data Center Program is hereby\ncreated and is to be administered as a program within the Division of Economic\nDevelopment to encourage the continued development, construction, operation,\nmaintenance, and expansion in West Virginia of high impact data centers. In\norder to effectuate the purposes of this section, the Division of Economic\nDevelopment, or any agency, division, or subdivision thereof, may promulgate\nlegislative rules, including emergency rules, in accordance with §29A-3-1 et\nseq. of this code.\n\n(c) Notification. -- Any data center shall compare its current or planned\noperations against the definition of \"high impact data center\" established in\n§11-6N-2 of this code and provide notification to the Division of Economic\nDevelopment when the data center becomes aware that it will satisfy or has\nsatisfied that definition. The notification will include information\naddressing the elements of that definition, including known or expected power\nconsumption of the data center. This notification shall be made (1) within 30\ndays after the data center determines that it meets these requirements, or (2)\nwhen the data center reasonably anticipates that it will, at some future date,\nmeet these requirements, in which case the data center may provide that\nanticipated future date in its notification.\n\n(d) Certification. -- The Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall\nidentify and certify high impact data centers in this state upon a finding\nthat a data center satisfies the requirements for the definition of \"high\nimpact data center\" set forth in §11-6N-2 of this code. The Secretary shall\nissue confirmation of certification to a high impact data center within 14\ndays following receipt of the notification from the data center required by\nthis section.\n\n(e) Recordkeeping. -- Any information provided by a data center pursuant to\nthis section that is identified by the data center as confidential business\ninformation shall be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The Secretary\nshall take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall maintain a complete list of\nall certified high impact data centers and all relevant information that can\nbe made available to the Governor and Legislature, removing specifically\nidentifying information to ensure confidentiality of any such information as\nidentified by any high impact data center.\n\n**§ 5B-2-21b.

PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.**\n\n**ARTICLE 2. POWERS AND DUTIES OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION.**\n\n**§ 24-2-1d. Future electric generating capacity requirements.**\n\n(a) In order to maximize the use of electricity generated within the state by\nusing coal or natural gas produced within the state, the Public Service\nCommission shall by order, no later than December 31, 1989, establish the\nschedule and amount of future electric generating capacity additions required\nby each West Virginia electric utility, for the next ten years, taking into\naccount: (i) Projected load growth; (ii) existing generating capacity; (iii)\nexisting contractual commitments to sell or purchase capacity; (iv) planned\nretirement and life extensions of existing capacity; (v) planned construction\nof capacity; (vi) availability of capacity from generating units of affiliated\ncompanies; (vii) capacity factors for existing generation; and (viii) such\nother reasonable factors as the commission may deem relevant and appropriate\nto consider. For purposes of this section, \"capacity factor\" shall mean the\nratio of the actual energy produced by a power plant over a specific period to\nthe maximum possible energy it could have produced if running at full capacity\nduring that same period.\n\n(b) If the commission determines after considering all such named and other\nrelevant and appropriate factors that a utility will be required to purchase\nelectric generating capacity beyond those agreements approved by the Federal\nEnergy Regulatory Commission or the West Virginia Public Service Commission in\norder to serve its West Virginia customers, the amount of such required\nadditional purchased capacity so identified by the commission will for\npurposes of this section be referred to as the utility's \"projected deficient\ncapacity\": Provided, That this subsection shall not include power generating\nfacilities whose total production of electricity is sold outside the State of\nWest Virginia.\n\n(c) In the interests of: Keeping utility rates of residential customers as low\nas possible; keeping utility rates for commercial and industrial customers\ncompetitive with those of other states; attracting new industry for which\nelectric power costs are a major factor in location determinations; and of not\nplacing any greater cost burden on government than is absolutely necessary for\nits electric power needs, each utility shall acquire, if reasonable, its\nprojected deficient capacity from electric generation situated in West\nVirginia which burns coal or gas produced in West Virginia and which will\nprovide the most reliable supply of capacity and energy at the least cost to\nthose customers of the utility who will be served by such electric generation:\nProvided, That all power purchase contracts executed prior to the effective\ndate of this section which satisfy the following requirements, regardless of\nlocation, shall be considered, for the purposes of this subsection, as\nelectric generation situated in West Virginia: (1) Said contracts were\nnegotiated in accordance with procedures and priced according to methodologies\nof other contracts which the commission has ordered approved; (2) said\ncontracts either guarantee or are substantially amended to guarantee for the\nlife of the contract the use of an amount of West Virginia fuel which equals\nor exceeds the amount which would be required, on a percentage of output\nbasis, to produce the amount of electric power to be consumed in West\nVirginia; and (3) said contracts meet the requirements for a qualifying\nfacility established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pursuant to\nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.\n\n(d) The commission shall evaluate each capacity auction conducted by PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor and, to the maximum extent permitted by\nlaw, encourage the coordination of the voluntary participation of every\nelectric generating unit in the state in each capacity auction for the benefit\nof ratepayers in the state.\n\n(e) In order to ensure the state's existing generating units can continue to\nmeet future generation needs, the commission shall conduct a review of each\ngenerating unit's current consumer economic dispatch. Factors to be considered\nby the commission in reviewing consumer economic dispatch shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (1) current capacity factors; (2) management of fuel\nsupplies and contracts; (3) overall plant operation and maintenance; (4)\nplacement of bids in the PJM Interconnection, LLC, or its successor's day-\nahead and real-time energy markets; (5) utilization of the PJM\nInterconnection, LLC, or its successor's Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) or\nFixed Resource Requirement (FRR); and (6) the utilization of automatic\nadjustment clauses, price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses by the\nutilities. For purposes of this section, \"consumer economic dispatch\" shall\nmean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at\nthe lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the\noperational limits of generation and transmission facilities.\n\n(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of\nelectricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result\nin reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers. The commission shall\nrequire the utilities to maintain their thermal baseload generating units in a\nmanner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-\nnine percent capacity factor. Nothing herein shall require a utility to\noperate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will\ncause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above\nthe established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or\nschedule. The commission shall propose rules for legislative approval in\naccordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code to carry out\nits duties and obligations as set forth herein.\n\n**§ 24-2-1q. Base fuel coal supply requirements for electric grid\nresiliency.**\n\nRecognizing that coal inventories at coal-fired power plants may increase and\ndecrease over time, in order to ensure grid resiliency and homeland security,\neach generating public utility shall plan incoming and outgoing coal so as to\nmaintain an average annual minimum 30-day aggregate coal supply on site at\neach coal-fired power plant. The commission may propose rules for legislative\napproval in accordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code to\ncarry out its duties and obligations as set forth herein.\n\n**§ 24-2-15. Certain Automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes or fuel\nadjustment.**\n\nThe commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or\notherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll or schedule as the result of any automatic adjustment\nclause, fuel supply price index, or fuel adjustment clause. Automatic\nadjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment\nclauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission.\nFor purposes of this section, a \"net increase\" in the charge or charges for\nelectric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which the automatic\nadjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause\nis utilized, the average charge or charges for electric energy are higher than\nthey would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price\nindex, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized. The commission shall\nencourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply\ncontract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing\nthe generation of coal-fired power plants within the state. The Commission\nshall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of automatic\nadjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel adjustment\nclauses.\n\n**§ 24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required.**\n\n(a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue\nan order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing\nrequirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the\nfuture review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an\ninitial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016,\nin conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or\nentities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for\ndeveloping an integrated resource plan.\n\n(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the\nPublic Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply\nside and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource\nplan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied.\nThereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource\nplan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.\n\n(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan\nshall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial\nintegrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt\nfrom filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated\nresource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at\nleast every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply\nwith the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission\nestablishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised\nintegrated resource plans.\n\n(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated\nresource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information\nfrom the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the\nobligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.\n\n(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources\nwhen developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan\nshall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity\nresources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a\nreasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in\nmeeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to\nits electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.\n\n(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025, require\nall electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their existing\nintegrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and maintenance\nplan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for ensuring the\noperation of each generating unit through their planned retirement date. The\nsupplemental integrated resource plan shall also include an analysis of the\naction necessary to extend the life of each generating unit beyond their\nplanned retirement date. Subject to notice and comment from interested\nparties, the commission may approve the supplemental integrated resource plan\nwithout modification or require modification of the supplemental plan before\nit is approved. The commission shall promulgate rules requiring the\nsupplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this provision.\nThe rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an\nindependent evaluation of any modification required by the commission\nhereunder or to challenge such required modification.\n\n**§ 24-2-21a. Commission authority required when closing an electric\ngenerating plant and circumstances of closure in another jurisdiction.**\n\n(a) A public electric utility may not retire, abandon, close, or otherwise\npermanently render incapable of operating, any electric generating plant or\nunit without the prior consent and approval of the commission. No funds\nobtained from (1) the Grid Stabilization and Security Fund set forth in\n5B-2N-2a, (2) an environmental control bond issued pursuant to 24-2-4e, (3) a\nconsumer rate relief bond issued pursuant to 24-2-4f, (4) or a utility\nconsumer rate relief bond issued pursuant to 24-2-4h shall be used by a public\nutility to retire, abandon, close, or otherwise permanently render incapable\nof operating, any electric generating plant or unit.\n\n(b) If an electric utility serving customers in both West Virginia and in an\narea not subject to the jurisdiction of the commission is ordered to cease\noperations of a generating plant or unit by the regulating authority of the\nother jurisdiction and the costs of the plant or unit had been shared through\nan allocation process for rate making purposes and after a commission\nproceeding and determination that a generating plant or unit should continue\nto operate, then the utility shall recover all of the capital, operating and\nmaintenance costs of the electric generation plant or unit from its West\nVirginia customers to the extent that such costs are no longer allocable to\nthe other jurisdiction, and all of the associated capacity, energy, and\nenvironmental attributes shall be assigned to its customers and operations in\nWest Virginia.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

Data Centers.</b>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(a) Findings and purpose. &mdash; The Legislature hereby finds and declares the following:</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy, generating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure investments, and technological innovation.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant, low-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation assets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(3) The People&rsquo;s Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global leader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of data toward China instead of toward the United States.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(4) It is in the United States&rsquo; national security interests to limit the flow of data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational power inside the United States. The President has declared that it is the policy of the United States &quot;to sustain and enhance America&rsquo;s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security.&quot; Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational power and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia. This severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national security vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and espionage against the Nation&rsquo;s critical data infrastructure.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the electric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of microgrids to provide their primary and backup power.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the United States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to Washington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the majority of the Nation&rsquo;s population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the least restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of abundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; (F) its supply of resources, such as coal mine methane blended with natural gas, to assist data centers locating in West Virginia to meet their energy needs and environmental goals; and (G) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of the lowest turnover rates in the Nation.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">As such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development and expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic growth. The Legislature finds that these externalities transcend local borders, including environmental concerns, energy consumption, and regional economic growth. Additionally, the provisions in this section align with the Legislature&rsquo;s goal of fostering a competitive, forward-thinking economy that benefits all residents.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(b) Program established. &mdash; The High Impact Data Center Program is hereby created and is to be administered as a program within the Division of Economic Development to encourage the continued development, construction, operation, maintenance, and expansion in West Virginia of high impact data centers. In order to effectuate the purposes of this section, the Division of Economic Development, or any agency, division, or subdivision thereof, may promulgate legislative rules, including emergency rules, in accordance with &sect;29A-3-1 et seq. of this code.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(c) Notification. &mdash; Any data center shall compare its current or planned operations against the definition of &quot;high impact data center&quot; established in &sect;11-6N-2 of this code and provide notification to the Division of Economic Development when the data center becomes aware that it will satisfy or has satisfied that definition. The notification will include information addressing the elements of that definition, including known or expected power consumption of the data center. This notification shall be made (1) within 30 days after the data center determines that it meets these requirements, or (2) when the data center reasonably anticipates that it will, at some future date, meet these requirements, in which case the data center may provide that anticipated future date in its notification.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(d) Certification. &mdash; The Secretary of the Department of Commerce shall identify and certify high impact data centers in this state upon a finding that a data center satisfies the requirements for the definition of &quot;high impact data center&quot; set forth in &sect;11-6N-2 of this code. The Secretary shall issue confirmation of certification to a high impact data center within 14 days following receipt of the notification from the data center required by this section.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">(e) Recordkeeping. &mdash; Any information provided by a data center pursuant to this section that is identified by the data center as confidential business information shall be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. The Secretary shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to protect this information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Secretary shall maintain a complete list of all certified high impact data centers and all relevant information that can be made available to the Governor and Legislature, removing specifically identifying information to ensure confidentiality of any such information as identified by any high impact data center.</p>\n   </div>\n   <a name=\"section-5B-2-21b-new\"></a><div title=\"Section: 5B-2-21b, Action: &quot;new&quot;\" class=\"sectionContent\">\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n     <b>&sect;5B-2-21b.

The commission shall issue a final order determining\nthe terms of a special contract within 90 days of filing of a petition.\n\n**§ 5B-2-21a. Data Centers.**\n\n(a) Findings and purpose. -- The Legislature hereby finds and declares the\nfollowing:\n\n(1) Data centers represent a significant and growing sector of the economy,\ngenerating substantial economic activity, including jobs, infrastructure\ninvestments, and technological innovation.\n\n(2) Data centers are critical national infrastructure that require abundant,\nlow-cost energy to protect sensitive data, operate high-level computation\nassets, and ensure the resilience of the digital economy.\n\n(3) The People's Republic of China is positioning itself to be the global\nleader of data centers and is investing in technology to encourage the flow of\ndata toward China instead of toward the United States.\n\n(4) It is in the United States' national security interests to limit the flow\nof data to China and to protect the flow of data and maximize computational\npower inside the United States. The President has declared that it is the\npolicy of the United States \"to sustain and enhance America's global AI\ndominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and\nnational security.\" Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial\nIntelligence, Executive Order 14179 (Jan 23, 2025).\n\n(5) As of early 2025, the highest concentration of high-level computational\npower and data centers in the world is located in Loudoun County, Virginia.\nThis severe concentration of data centers in one location is a national\nsecurity vulnerability because it invites the potential for cyberattacks and\nespionage against the Nation's critical data infrastructure.\n\n(6) Data centers have historically obtained their electricity from the\nelectric grid. Some data center developers now seek or require the use of\nmicrogrids to provide their primary and backup power.\n\n(7) West Virginia is strategically positioned as the best location in the\nUnited States to place data centers due to: (A) its close proximity to\nWashington, D.C., and the federal government; (B) its close proximity to the\nmajority of the Nation's population; (C) its low tax rates; (D) it having the\nleast restrictive regulatory environment in the Nation; (E) its supply of\nabundant energy and natural resources to power the data centers; (F) its\nsupply of resources, such as coal mine methane blended with natural gas, to\nassist data centers locating in West Virginia to meet their energy needs and\nenvironmental goals; and (G) its skilled and loyal workforce that has some of\nthe lowest turnover rates in the Nation.\n\nAs such, the state has a significant interest in encouraging the development\nand expansion of data centers, which can serve as drivers of broader economic\ngrowth.

For purposes of this section, \"consumer economic dispatch\" shall\nmean the process of operating generation facilities to produce electricity at\nthe lowest cost while reliably meeting consumer demand, considering the\noperational limits of generation and transmission facilities.\n\n(f) Electric utilities shall be prepared to maximize the production of\nelectricity from their generating units when such self-generation will result\nin reduced energy costs for West Virginia ratepayers. The commission shall\nrequire the utilities to maintain their thermal baseload generating units in a\nmanner to allow them to be able to self-generate and achieve at least a sixty-\nnine percent capacity factor. Nothing herein shall require a utility to\noperate a generating unit at a sixty-nine percent capacity if doing so will\ncause an increase in the charge or charges for electric energy over and above\nthe established and published tariff, rate, joint rate, charge, toll or\nschedule. The commission shall propose rules for legislative approval in\naccordance with the provisions of §29A-3-1 et seq. of this code to carry out\nits duties and obligations as set forth herein.\n\n**§ 24-2-1q.

Certain Automatic adjustment clauses, price indexes or fuel\nadjustment.**\n\nThe commission shall not enforce, originate, continue, establish, change or\notherwise authorize or permit an increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll or schedule as the result of any automatic adjustment\nclause, fuel supply price index, or fuel adjustment clause. Automatic\nadjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, or fuel adjustment\nclauses that do not create a net increase in the charge or charges for\nelectric energy over and above the established and published tariff, rate,\njoint rate, charge, toll, or schedule shall be permitted by the commission.\nFor purposes of this section, a \"net increase\" in the charge or charges for\nelectric service shall mean that for the calendar year in which the automatic\nadjustment clause, fuel supply contract price index, or fuel adjustment clause\nis utilized, the average charge or charges for electric energy are higher than\nthey would have been if the adjustment clause, fuel supply contract price\nindex, or fuel adjustment clause were not utilized. The commission shall\nencourage the use of permitted automatic adjustment clauses, fuel supply\ncontract price indexes, or fuel adjustment clauses as a means of increasing\nthe generation of coal-fired power plants within the state. The Commission\nshall promulgate procedural rules governing the utilization of automatic\nadjustment clauses, fuel supply contract price indexes, and fuel adjustment\nclauses.\n\n**§ 24-2-19. Integrated Resource Planning Required.**\n\n(a) Not later than March 31, 2015, the Public Service Commission shall issue\nan order directing any electric utility that does not have an existing\nrequirement approved by the Public Service Commission that provides for the\nfuture review of both supply side and demand side resources to develop an\ninitial integrated resource plan to be filed not later than January 1, 2016,\nin conjunction with other similar deadlines required by other states or\nentities of the electric utilities. This order may include guidelines for\ndeveloping an integrated resource plan.\n\n(b)(1) Any electric utility that has an existing requirement approved by the\nPublic Service Commission that provides for the future review of both supply\nside and demand side resources is exempt from this initial integrated resource\nplan filing until such time as that existing requirement has been satisfied.\nThereafter, such electric utility is required to file an integrated resource\nplan pursuant to §24-2-19(a) of this code.\n\n(2) Each electric utility that has filed the initial integrated resource plan\nshall file an updated plan at least every five years after the initial\nintegrated resource plan has been filed. Any electric utility that was exempt\nfrom filing an initial integrated resource plan shall file an integrated\nresource plan within five years of satisfying any existing requirement and at\nleast every five years thereafter. All integrated resource plans shall comply\nwith the provisions of any relevant order of the Public Service Commission\nestablishing guidelines for the format and contents of updated and revised\nintegrated resource plans.\n\n(c) The Public Service Commission shall analyze and review an integrated\nresource plan. The Public Service Commission may request further information\nfrom the utility, as necessary. Nothing in this section affects the\nobligations of utilities to obtain otherwise applicable commission approvals.\n\n(d) The Commission may consider both supply-side and demand-side resources\nwhen developing the requirements for the integrated resource plans. The plan\nshall compare projected peak demands with current and planned capacity\nresources in order to develop a portfolio of resources that represents a\nreasonable balance of cost and risk for the utility and its customers in\nmeeting future demand for the provision of adequate and reliable service to\nits electric customers as specified by the Public Service Commission.\n\n(e) The commission shall by order, entered no later than July 1, 2025, require\nall electric utilities operating in the state to supplement their existing\nintegrated resource plans to include a detailed plant upgrade and maintenance\nplan, improvement compliance schedule, and cost estimate for ensuring the\noperation of each generating unit through their planned retirement date. The\nsupplemental integrated resource plan shall also include an analysis of the\naction necessary to extend the life of each generating unit beyond their\nplanned retirement date. Subject to notice and comment from interested\nparties, the commission may approve the supplemental integrated resource plan\nwithout modification or require modification of the supplemental plan before\nit is approved. The commission shall promulgate rules requiring the\nsupplementation of integrated resource plans as required by this provision.\nThe rules shall also provide a procedure for utilities to submit an\nindependent evaluation of any modification required by the commission\nhereunder or to challenge such required modification.\n\n**§ 24-2-21a. Commission authority required when closing an electric\ngenerating plant and circumstances of closure in another jurisdiction.**\n\n(a) A public electric utility may not retire, abandon, close, or otherwise\npermanently render incapable of operating, any electric generating plant or\nunit without the prior consent and approval of the commission.
