Existing law also requires the social media platform to collect information reasonably sufficient to enable the social media platform to contact, as specified, a reporting user.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would delete the requirement for reporting material that the reporting user be depicted in the material, would require that the depicted individual be depicted as a minor,<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> and</u> would additionally require the mechanism to be clear and<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> conspicuous, and</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> conspicuous.

The bill would make a social media company liable to a depicted individual, as defined, for specified violations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law prohibits a social media platform from knowingly facilitating, aiding, or abetting commercial sexual exploitation, as defined, and exempts a social media platform from being deemed in violation of that prohibition if it instituted a specified audit program and provided to each member of its board of directors a true and correct copy of each audit, as prescribed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would revise those provisions to, instead, require a social media platform to submit to third-party audits and release audit reports to the public in order to be exempt from being deemed in violation that prohibition, as prescribed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would declare that its provisions are severable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.
