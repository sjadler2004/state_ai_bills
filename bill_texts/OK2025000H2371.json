The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, in cooperation with the Oklahoma State Department of Education, shall solicit proposals for, and if funds are available, make grants to local boards of education for the establishment of pilot programs that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) software as a safety tool to monitor school issued devices.

Funding may cover the cost of software, equipment, materials, personnel, and any other start-up costs of developing the pilot program.
