The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or specified. By operation of law, political subdivisions are required to comply with any state mandate included in the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The bill authorizes the attorney general to adopt rules to administer and interpret the bill.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The bill requires the attorney general to create a transitional reporting system within 30 days following the bill&rsquo;s effective date that will operate until 59 days following the bill&rsquo;s effective date. The bill requires the transitional reporting system to include, at a minimum, a mechanism for the electronic submission of reports of potential violations of the bill and the electronic evidence associated with the potential violations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to agreements between a company and a governmental entity in effect or entered into on or after the effective date of the bill.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",
