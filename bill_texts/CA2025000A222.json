The standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in which case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be sold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the manufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other cost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall be drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the appliances concerned. &quot;Sold or offered for sale in the state&quot; means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in the state, regardless of the seller&#39;s physical location, and includes, without limitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of this section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define &quot;sold or offered for sale&quot; or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant to clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the following factors:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date of adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to subparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards adopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all parties concerning the parties&#39; design recommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the proposed standard.

When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of complying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph (1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or offered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is permanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a standard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or decrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard for that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts other cost-effective measures for that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to decrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30, 1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy conservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a four-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there is significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the adoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall notify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend a standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this paragraph, the commission may do any of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard up to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers or, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established in a similar nationwide consensus standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard to reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers to use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally defective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action determines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is not more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or preempted.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating efficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in Section 8558 of the Government Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new facility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible. A site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards recommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall include a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the recommended standards will be achieved.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for appliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These regulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances with flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improvements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted, or curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction. The standards shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of their adoption or updating.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) In adopting the flexible demand appliance standards, the commission shall consider the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#39;s reliability and cybersecurity protocols, or other cybersecurity protocols that are equally or more protective, and shall adopt, at a minimum, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation&#39;s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) The flexible demand appliance standards shall be cost effective.

This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(3) Water efficiency standards and water conservation design standards adopted\npursuant to this subdivision and subdivision (b) shall be consistent with the\nlegislative findings of this division to ensure and maintain a reliable supply\nof electrical energy and be equivalent to or superior to the performance,\nsafety, and protection of life, health, and general welfare standards\ncontained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. The commission\nshall consult with the members of the coordinating council as established in\nSection 18926 of the Health and Safety Code in the development of these\nstandards.\n\n(b) (1) Prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design\nstandards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. The standards\nshall be performance standards and shall be promulgated in terms of energy\nconsumption per gross square foot of floorspace, but may also include devices,\nsystems, and techniques required to conserve energy and water. The commission\nshall periodically review the standards and adopt any revision that, in its\njudgment, it deems necessary. A building that satisfies the standards\nprescribed pursuant to this subdivision need not comply with the standards\nprescribed pursuant to subdivision (a). Water conservation design standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission\nto be necessary to save energy. Before adopting a water conservation design\nstandard for residential buildings, the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment and the commission shall issue a joint finding whether the\nstandard (A) is equivalent or superior in performance, in safety, and for the\nprotection of life, health, and general welfare to standards in Title 24 of\nthe California Code of Regulations, and (B) does not unreasonably or\nunnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to purchase or rent\naffordable housing, as determined by taking account of the overall benefit\nderived from the water conservation design standards. This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(2) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to subdivision (a) and this subdivision, the commission\nshall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section\n18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to\nthe proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed\nregulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice\nof these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral\ncomments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take\ninto consideration input from all parties concerning the parties' design\nrecommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect\nconsumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission\nshall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed\naction any input provided during these public meetings.\n\n(3) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to subdivision (a) and this\nsubdivision shall be cost effective when taken in their entirety and when\namortized over the economic life of the structure compared with historic\npractice. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider\nthe value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the\nconsumer, and the life-cycle cost of complying with the standard. The\ncommission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections\n18930 and 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to,\nthe impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the\nstandard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and\nany alternative approaches and their associated costs.\n\n_(4) (A) For purposes of this paragraph, \"data center\" has the same meaning as\ndefined in Section 25345._\n\n_(B) On or before January 1, 2027, the commission shall adopt efficiency\nstandards for data centers that do all of the following:_\n\n_(i) Be technologically feasible and cost effective._\n\n_(ii) Align with California 's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets._\n\n_(iii) Require new data centers and substantial alterations to existing data\ncenters to incorporate load-management and load-shifting capabilities,\nincluding the ability to participate in demand response programs._\n\n_(C) Before initially operating as a data center and following any change that\nmaterially affects the correctness of information previously provided to the\ncommission, a data center shall report all of the following information to the\ncommission:_\n\n_(i) The name of the data center._\n\n_(ii) Any physical addresses associated with the operation of the data\ncenter._\n\n_(iii) The internet website of the data center if the data center has a\ninternet website._\n\n_(iv) A telephone number and email address for a point of contact for the\ncommission to communicate with the data center._\n\n_(D) The commission shall include energy consumption trends for data centers\nin its integrated energy policy report prepared pursuant to Section 25302._\n\n(c) (1) (A) (i) Prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of\noperating efficiency, based on a reasonable use pattern, and may prescribe\nother cost-effective measures, including incentive programs, fleet averaging,\nenergy and water consumption labeling not preempted by federal labeling law,\nand consumer education programs, to promote the use of energy- and water-\nefficient appliances whose use, as determined by the commission, requires a\nsignificant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. The minimum levels\nof operating efficiency shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies\nor feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water\nconsumption growth rates. The standards for minimum levels of operating\nefficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\nadoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in\nwhich case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the\ndate of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the\neffective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be\nsold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the\nmanufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other\ncost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall\nbe drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers\nover the designed life of the appliances concerned. \"Sold or offered for sale\nin the state\" means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in\nthe state, regardless of the seller's physical location, and includes, without\nlimitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of\nthis section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with\nSection 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define \"sold or offered for\nsale\" or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.\n\n(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming\neffective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant\nto clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the\nfollowing factors:\n\n(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed\nstandard.\n\n(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.\n\n(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.\n\n(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date\nof adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.\n\n(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to\nsubparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.\n\n(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication\nof the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and\nSafety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations\nin public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected\nparties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an\nopportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings,\nthe commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all\nparties concerning the parties' design recommendations, cost considerations,\nand other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the\nproposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the\nstart of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public\nmeetings.\n\n(C) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to this subdivision shall not\nresult in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the\nappliances concerned. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission\nshall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product\nefficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of\ncomplying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph\n(1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or\noffered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is\npermanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.\n\n(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a\nstandard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or\ndecrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard\nfor that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts\nother cost-effective measures for that appliance.\n\n(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to\ndecrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30,\n1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy\nconservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a\nfour-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there\nis significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the\nadoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall\nnotify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend\na standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this\nparagraph, the commission may do any of the following:\n\n(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nup to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by\nthe American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers\nor, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established\nin a similar nationwide consensus standard.\n\n(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum\nlevel of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.\n\n(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nto reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers\nto use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency\nremains substantially the same.\n\n(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally\ndefective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action\ndetermines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is\nnot more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or\npreempted.\n\n(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating\nefficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in\nSection 8558 of the Government Code.\n\n(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new\nfacility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible.\nA site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6\n(commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards\nrecommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall\ninclude a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the\nrecommended standards will be achieved.\n\n(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for\nappliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These\nregulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances\nwith flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards\nshall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible\nimprovements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted,\nor curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases\nassociated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction. The\nstandards shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\ntheir adoption or updating.\n\n(2) In adopting the flexible demand appliance standards, the commission shall\nconsider the National Institute of Standards and Technology's reliability and\ncybersecurity protocols, or other cybersecurity protocols that are equally or\nmore protective, and shall adopt, at a minimum, the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation's Critical Infrastructure Protection standards.\n\n(3) The flexible demand appliance standards shall be cost effective. When\ndetermining cost-effectiveness, solely for purposes of this subdivision, the\ncommission may consider, as appropriate, the cost of flexible demand\nappliances compared to nonflexible demand appliances, the value of increased\nor decreased emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the timing of an\nappliance's use, the life-cycle cost to the consumer from using a product that\ncomplies with the standard, and the life-cycle costs and benefits to\nconsumers, including the ability to conserve energy and better align consumer\nand electric system demand. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(4) The commission shall consult with the Public Utilities Commission, load-\nserving entities, and local publicly owned electric utilities to better align\nthe flexible demand appliance standards with demand response programs\nadministered by the state and load-serving entities and local publicly owned\nelectric utilities and to incentivize the deployment of flexible demand\nappliances.\n\n(5) The flexible demand appliance standards shall prioritize all of the\nfollowing:\n\n(A) Appliances that can more conveniently have their electrical demand\ncontrolled by load-management technology and third-party load-management\nprograms.\n\n(B) Appliances with load-management technology options that are readily\navailable.\n\n(C) Appliances that have a user-friendly interface and follow a\nstraightforward setup and connection process, such as remote setup by means of\nan internet website or application.\n\n(D) Appliances with load-management technology options that follow simple\nstandards for third-party direct operation of the appliances.\n\n(E) Appliances that are interoperable or open source.\n\n(6) On or before January 1, 2021, and as necessary thereafter, the commission\nshall include as part of each integrated energy policy report adopted pursuant\nto Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 25300) a description of any actions it\nhas taken pursuant to this subdivision and the flexible demand appliance\nstandards' cost to consumers.\n\n(7) For purposes of this subdivision, all of the following definitions apply:\n\n(A) \"Flexible demand\" means the capability to schedule, shift, or curtail the\nelectrical demand of a load-serving entity's customer or a local publicly\nowned electric utility's customer through direct action by the customer or\nthrough action by a third party, the load-serving entity, or a grid balancing\nauthority, with the customer's consent.\n\n(B) \"Load-serving entity\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 380 of\nthe Public Utilities Code.\n\n(C) \"Local publicly owned electric utility\" has the same meaning as defined in\nSection 224.3 of the Public Utilities Code.\n\n~~SEC. 2. Section 451.10 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:~~\n\n~~451.10.~~ _SEC. 3._\n\n_Section 451.4 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:_\n\n_451.4._ (a) For purposes of this section, \"data center\" has the same meaning\nas defined in Section 25345 of the Public Resources Code.\n\n(b) In an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and\nexpenses arising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new\ndata center or a substantial alteration to an existing data center, the\ncommission shall determine whether those costs and expenses are just and\nreasonable in accordance with Section 451.\n\n(c) In determining whether costs and expenses are just and reasonable pursuant\nto subdivision (b), the commission shall minimize the shifting of costs\nattributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to\nratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 18930 and 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) (A) For purposes of this paragraph, &quot;data center&quot; has the same meaning as defined in Section 25345.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) On or before January 1, 2027, the commission shall adopt efficiency standards for data centers that do all of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Be technologically feasible and cost effective.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Align with California&#39;s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) Require new data centers and substantial alterations to existing data centers to incorporate load-management and load-shifting capabilities, including the ability to participate in demand response programs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Before initially operating as a data center and following any change that materially affects the correctness of information previously provided to the commission, a data center shall report all of the following information to the commission:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) The name of the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Any physical addresses associated with the operation of the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The internet website of the data center if the data center has<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> a</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> an</u> internet website.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) A telephone number and email address for a point of contact for the commission to communicate with the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) The commission shall include energy consumption trends for data centers in its integrated energy policy report prepared pursuant to Section 25302.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) (1) (A) (i) Prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency, based on a reasonable use pattern, and may prescribe other cost-effective measures, including incentive programs, fleet averaging, energy and water consumption labeling not preempted by federal labeling law, and consumer education programs, to promote the use of energy- and water-efficient appliances whose use, as determined by the commission, requires a significant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. The minimum levels of operating efficiency shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water consumption growth rates. The standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in which case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be sold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the manufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other cost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall be drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the appliances concerned. &quot;Sold or offered for sale in the state&quot; means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in the state, regardless of the seller&#39;s physical location, and includes, without limitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of this section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define &quot;sold or offered for sale&quot; or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant to clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the following factors:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date of adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to subparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards adopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all parties concerning the parties&#39; design recommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public meetings.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to this subdivision shall not result in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the appliances concerned. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of complying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph (1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or offered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is permanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a standard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or decrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard for that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts other cost-effective measures for that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to decrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30, 1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy conservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a four-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there is significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the adoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall notify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend a standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this paragraph, the commission may do any of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard up to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers or, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established in a similar nationwide consensus standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard to reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers to use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally defective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action determines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is not more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or preempted.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating efficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in Section 8558 of the Government Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new facility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible. A site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards recommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall include a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the recommended standards will be achieved.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for appliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These regulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances with flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improvements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted, or curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction.

Data centers: energy usage reporting and\nefficiency standards: electricity rates.\n\nExisting law, on or before January 1, 2026, and before each time thereafter\nthat a generative artificial intelligence system or service, as defined, or a\nsubstantial modification to a generative artificial intelligence system or\nservice, released on or after January 1, 2022, is made available to\nCalifornians for use, regardless of whether the terms of that use include\ncompensation, requires a developer of the system or service to post on the\ndeveloper's internet website documentation regarding the data used to train\nthe generative artificial intelligence system or service.\n\nThis bill would require a developer, before using a covered model commercially\nor before making a covered model available for use by a third party,\nto~~calculate~~ _estimate_ the total energy used to develop the covered model\nand the percentage of the total energy used to develop the covered model that\nwas generated in California._The bill would also require a developer, on or\nbefore February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, to estimate the total energy\nused by the developer to operate the covered model during the previous\ncalendar year and the percentage of the estimated total energy that was\ngenerated in California._ The bill would require the developer to publish on\nits internet website that energy usage data, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development\nCommission (Energy Commission) to biennially adopt an integrated energy policy\nreport, as specified, and to make the reports accessible to state, local, and\nfederal entities and to the general public. Existing law requires the Energy\nCommission to prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design\nstandards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings, as provided.\n\nThis bill would require the Energy Commission to include energy consumption\ntrends for data centers in its integrated energy policy reports. The bill\nwould require the Energy Commission, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt\nefficiency standards for data centers, as provided.\n\nExisting law vests the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with regulatory\nauthority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing\nlaw authorizes the PUC to fix the rates and charges for every public utility,\nand requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.\n\nThis bill would require the PUC to determine whether those costs and expenses\nin an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and expenses\narising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new data\ncenter or a substantial alteration to an existing data center are just and\nreasonable. The bill would require the PUC to minimize the shifting of costs\nattributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to\nratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

Water efficiency standards adopted pursuant to\nthis subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission to be necessary to\nsave energy.\n\n(2) Before adopting a water efficiency standard for residential buildings, the\nDepartment of Housing and Community Development and the commission shall issue\na joint finding whether the standard (A) is equivalent or superior in\nperformance, in safety, and for the protection of life, health, and general\nwelfare to standards in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations and (B)\ndoes not unreasonably or unnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to\npurchase or rent affordable housing, as determined by taking account of the\noverall benefit derived from water efficiency standards. This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(3) Water efficiency standards and water conservation design standards adopted\npursuant to this subdivision and subdivision (b) shall be consistent with the\nlegislative findings of this division to ensure and maintain a reliable supply\nof electrical energy and be equivalent to or superior to the performance,\nsafety, and protection of life, health, and general welfare standards\ncontained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. The commission\nshall consult with the members of the coordinating council as established in\nSection 18926 of the Health and Safety Code in the development of these\nstandards.\n\n(b) (1) Prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design\nstandards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. The standards\nshall be performance standards and shall be promulgated in terms of energy\nconsumption per gross square foot of floorspace, but may also include devices,\nsystems, and techniques required to conserve energy and water. The commission\nshall periodically review the standards and adopt any revision that, in its\njudgment, it deems necessary. A building that satisfies the standards\nprescribed pursuant to this subdivision need not comply with the standards\nprescribed pursuant to subdivision (a). Water conservation design standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission\nto be necessary to save energy. Before adopting a water conservation design\nstandard for residential buildings, the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment and the commission shall issue a joint finding whether the\nstandard (A) is equivalent or superior in performance, in safety, and for the\nprotection of life, health, and general welfare to standards in Title 24 of\nthe California Code of Regulations, and (B) does not unreasonably or\nunnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to purchase or rent\naffordable housing, as determined by taking account of the overall benefit\nderived from the water conservation design standards. This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(2) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to subdivision (a) and this subdivision, the commission\nshall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section\n18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to\nthe proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed\nregulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice\nof these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral\ncomments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take\ninto consideration input from all parties concerning the parties' design\nrecommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect\nconsumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission\nshall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed\naction any input provided during these public meetings.\n\n(3) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to subdivision (a) and this\nsubdivision shall be cost effective when taken in their entirety and when\namortized over the economic life of the structure compared with historic\npractice. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider\nthe value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the\nconsumer, and the life-cycle cost of complying with the standard. The\ncommission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections\n18930 and 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to,\nthe impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the\nstandard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and\nany alternative approaches and their associated costs.\n\n(4) (A) For purposes of this paragraph, \"data center\" has the same meaning as\ndefined in Section 25345.\n\n(B) On or before January 1, 2027, the commission shall adopt efficiency\nstandards for data centers that do all of the following:\n\n(i) Be technologically feasible and cost effective.\n\n(ii) Align with California's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\n\n(iii) Require new data centers and substantial alterations to existing data\ncenters to incorporate load-management and load-shifting capabilities,\nincluding the ability to participate in demand response programs.\n\n(C) Before initially operating as a data center and following any change that\nmaterially affects the correctness of information previously provided to the\ncommission, a data center shall report all of the following information to the\ncommission:\n\n(i) The name of the data center.\n\n(ii) Any physical addresses associated with the operation of the data center.\n\n(iii) The internet website of the data center if the data center has~~a~~ _an_\ninternet website.\n\n(iv) A telephone number and email address for a point of contact for the\ncommission to communicate with the data center.\n\n(D) The commission shall include energy consumption trends for data centers in\nits integrated energy policy report prepared pursuant to Section 25302.\n\n(c) (1) (A) (i) Prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of\noperating efficiency, based on a reasonable use pattern, and may prescribe\nother cost-effective measures, including incentive programs, fleet averaging,\nenergy and water consumption labeling not preempted by federal labeling law,\nand consumer education programs, to promote the use of energy- and water-\nefficient appliances whose use, as determined by the commission, requires a\nsignificant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. The minimum levels\nof operating efficiency shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies\nor feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water\nconsumption growth rates. The standards for minimum levels of operating\nefficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\nadoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in\nwhich case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the\ndate of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the\neffective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be\nsold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the\nmanufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other\ncost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall\nbe drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers\nover the designed life of the appliances concerned. \"Sold or offered for sale\nin the state\" means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in\nthe state, regardless of the seller's physical location, and includes, without\nlimitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of\nthis section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with\nSection 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define \"sold or offered for\nsale\" or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.\n\n(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming\neffective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant\nto clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the\nfollowing factors:\n\n(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed\nstandard.\n\n(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.\n\n(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.\n\n(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date\nof adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.\n\n(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to\nsubparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.\n\n(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication\nof the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and\nSafety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations\nin public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected\nparties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an\nopportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings,\nthe commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all\nparties concerning the parties' design recommendations, cost considerations,\nand other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the\nproposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the\nstart of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public\nmeetings.\n\n(C) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to this subdivision shall not\nresult in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the\nappliances concerned. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission\nshall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product\nefficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of\ncomplying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph\n(1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or\noffered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is\npermanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.\n\n(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a\nstandard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or\ndecrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard\nfor that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts\nother cost-effective measures for that appliance.\n\n(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to\ndecrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30,\n1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy\nconservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a\nfour-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there\nis significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the\nadoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall\nnotify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend\na standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this\nparagraph, the commission may do any of the following:\n\n(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nup to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by\nthe American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers\nor, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established\nin a similar nationwide consensus standard.\n\n(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum\nlevel of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.\n\n(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nto reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers\nto use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency\nremains substantially the same.\n\n(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally\ndefective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action\ndetermines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is\nnot more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or\npreempted.\n\n(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating\nefficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in\nSection 8558 of the Government Code.\n\n(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new\nfacility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible.\nA site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6\n(commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards\nrecommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall\ninclude a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the\nrecommended standards will be achieved.\n\n(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for\nappliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These\nregulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances\nwith flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards\nshall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible\nimprovements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted,\nor curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases\nassociated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction. The\nstandards shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\ntheir adoption or updating.\n\n(2) In adopting the flexible demand appliance standards, the commission shall\nconsider the National Institute of Standards and Technology's reliability and\ncybersecurity protocols, or other cybersecurity protocols that are equally or\nmore protective, and shall adopt, at a minimum, the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation's Critical Infrastructure Protection standards.\n\n(3) The flexible demand appliance standards shall be cost effective. When\ndetermining cost-effectiveness, solely for purposes of this subdivision, the\ncommission may consider, as appropriate, the cost of flexible demand\nappliances compared to nonflexible demand appliances, the value of increased\nor decreased emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the timing of an\nappliance's use, the life-cycle cost to the consumer from using a product that\ncomplies with the standard, and the life-cycle costs and benefits to\nconsumers, including the ability to conserve energy and better align consumer\nand electric system demand. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(4) The commission shall consult with the Public Utilities Commission, load-\nserving entities, and local publicly owned electric utilities to better align\nthe flexible demand appliance standards with demand response programs\nadministered by the state and load-serving entities and local publicly owned\nelectric utilities and to incentivize the deployment of flexible demand\nappliances.\n\n(5) The flexible demand appliance standards shall prioritize all of the\nfollowing:\n\n(A) Appliances that can more conveniently have their electrical demand\ncontrolled by load-management technology and third-party load-management\nprograms.\n\n(B) Appliances with load-management technology options that are readily\navailable.\n\n(C) Appliances that have a user-friendly interface and follow a\nstraightforward setup and connection process, such as remote setup by means of\nan internet website or application.\n\n(D) Appliances with load-management technology options that follow simple\nstandards for third-party direct operation of the appliances.\n\n(E) Appliances that are interoperable or open source.\n\n(6) On or before January 1, 2021, and as necessary thereafter, the commission\nshall include as part of each integrated energy policy report adopted pursuant\nto Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 25300) a description of any actions it\nhas taken pursuant to this subdivision and the flexible demand appliance\nstandards' cost to consumers.\n\n(7) For purposes of this subdivision, all of the following definitions apply:\n\n(A) \"Flexible demand\" means the capability to schedule, shift, or curtail the\nelectrical demand of a load-serving entity's customer or a local publicly\nowned electric utility's customer through direct action by the customer or\nthrough action by a third party, the load-serving entity, or a grid balancing\nauthority, with the customer's consent.\n\n(B) \"Load-serving entity\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 380 of\nthe Public Utilities Code.\n\n(C) \"Local publicly owned electric utility\" has the same meaning as defined in\nSection 224.3 of the Public Utilities Code.\n\nSEC. 3. Section 451.4 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:\n\n451.4. (a) For purposes of this section, \"data center\" has the same meaning as\ndefined in Section 25345 of the Public Resources Code.\n\n(b) In an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and\nexpenses arising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new\ndata center or a substantial alteration to an existing data center, the\ncommission shall determine whether those costs and expenses are just and\nreasonable in accordance with Section 451.\n\n(c) In determining whether costs and expenses are just and reasonable pursuant\nto subdivision (b), the commission shall minimize the shifting of costs\nattributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to\nratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

Data centers: energy usage reporting and efficiency standards: electricity rates.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, on or before January 1, 2026, and before each time thereafter that a generative artificial intelligence system or service, as defined, or a substantial modification to a generative artificial intelligence system or service, released on or after January 1, 2022, is made available to Californians for use, regardless of whether the terms of that use include compensation, requires a developer of the system or service to post on the developer&#39;s internet website documentation regarding the data used to train the generative artificial intelligence system or service.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require a developer, before using a covered model commercially or before making a covered model available for use by a third party, to estimate the total energy used to develop the covered model and the percentage of the total energy used to develop the covered model that was generated in California. The bill would also require a developer, on or before February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, to estimate the total energy used by the developer to operate the covered model during the previous calendar year and the percentage of the estimated total energy that was generated in California. The bill would require the developer to publish on its internet website that energy usage data, as provided.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (Energy Commission) to biennially adopt an integrated energy policy report, as specified, and to make the reports accessible to state, local, and federal entities and to the general public.<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> Existing law requires the Energy Commission to prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings, as provided.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require the Energy Commission to include energy consumption trends for data centers in its integrated energy policy reports.<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> The bill would require the Energy Commission, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt efficiency standards for data centers, as provided.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law vests the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law authorizes the PUC to fix the rates and charges for every public utility, and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require the PUC to determine whether those costs and expenses in an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and expenses arising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new data center or a substantial alteration to an existing data center are just and reasonable. The bill would require the PUC to minimize the shifting of costs attributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to ratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Vote: MAJORITY  Appropriation: NO  Fiscal Committee: YES  Local Program: NO</p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1. Chapter 4.4 (commencing with Section 25345) is added to Division 15 of the Public Resources Code, to read:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> CHAPTER 4.4.

This subdivision does not in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community Development to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing Law (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Water efficiency standards and water conservation design standards adopted pursuant to this subdivision and subdivision (b) shall be consistent with the legislative findings of this division to ensure and maintain a reliable supply of electrical energy and be equivalent to or superior to the performance, safety, and protection of life, health, and general welfare standards contained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. The commission shall consult with the members of the coordinating council as established in Section 18926 of the Health and Safety Code in the development of these standards.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) (1) Prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design standards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. The standards shall be performance standards and shall be promulgated in terms of energy consumption per gross square foot of floorspace, but may also include devices, systems, and techniques required to conserve energy and water. The commission shall periodically review the standards and adopt any revision that, in its judgment, it deems necessary. A building that satisfies the standards prescribed pursuant to this subdivision need not comply with the standards prescribed pursuant to subdivision (a). Water conservation design standards adopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission to be necessary to save energy. Before adopting a water conservation design standard for residential buildings, the Department of Housing and Community Development and the commission shall issue a joint finding whether the standard (A) is equivalent or superior in performance, in safety, and for the protection of life, health, and general welfare to standards in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, and (B) does not unreasonably or unnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to purchase or rent affordable housing, as determined by taking account of the overall benefit derived from the water conservation design standards. This subdivision does not in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community Development to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing Law (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and Safety Code).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards adopted pursuant to subdivision (a) and this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all parties concerning the parties&#39; design recommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public meetings.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to subdivision (a) and this subdivision shall be cost effective when taken in their entirety and when amortized over the economic life of the structure compared with historic practice. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost of complying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 18930 and 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) (A) For purposes of this paragraph, &quot;data center&quot; has the same meaning as defined in Section 25345.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(B) On or before January 1, 2027, the commission shall adopt efficiency standards for data centers that do all of the following:</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(i) Be technologically feasible and cost effective.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(ii) Align with California&#39;s greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(iii) Require new data centers and substantial alterations to existing data centers to incorporate load-management and load-shifting capabilities, including the ability to participate in demand response programs.</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(C)</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(B)</u> Before initially operating as a data center and following any change that materially affects the correctness of information previously provided to the commission, a data center shall report all of the following information to the commission:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) The name of the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Any physical addresses associated with the operation of the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The internet website of the data center if the data center has an internet website.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) A telephone number and email address for a point of contact for the commission to communicate with the data center.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">(D)</strike>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(C)</u> The commission shall include energy consumption trends for data centers in its integrated energy policy report prepared pursuant to Section 25302.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) (1) (A) (i) Prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency, based on a reasonable use pattern, and may prescribe other cost-effective measures, including incentive programs, fleet averaging, energy and water consumption labeling not preempted by federal labeling law, and consumer education programs, to promote the use of energy- and water-efficient appliances whose use, as determined by the commission, requires a significant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. The minimum levels of operating efficiency shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water consumption growth rates. The standards for minimum levels of operating efficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in which case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the effective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be sold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the manufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other cost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall be drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the appliances concerned. &quot;Sold or offered for sale in the state&quot; means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in the state, regardless of the seller&#39;s physical location, and includes, without limitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of this section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define &quot;sold or offered for sale&quot; or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming effective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant to clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the following factors:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date of adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to subparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards adopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all parties concerning the parties&#39; design recommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public meetings.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to this subdivision shall not result in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the appliances concerned. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of complying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph (1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or offered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is permanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a standard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or decrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard for that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts other cost-effective measures for that appliance.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to decrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30, 1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy conservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a four-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there is significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the adoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall notify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend a standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this paragraph, the commission may do any of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard up to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers or, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established in a similar nationwide consensus standard.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard to reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers to use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally defective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action determines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is not more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or preempted.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating efficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in Section 8558 of the Government Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new facility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible. A site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards recommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall include a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the recommended standards will be achieved.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for appliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These regulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances with flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible improvements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted, or curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction. The standards shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of their adoption or updating.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) In adopting the flexible demand appliance standards, the commission shall consider the National Institute of Standards and Technology&#39;s reliability and cybersecurity protocols, or other cybersecurity protocols that are equally or more protective, and shall adopt, at a minimum, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation&#39;s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) The flexible demand appliance standards shall be cost effective. When determining cost-effectiveness, solely for purposes of this subdivision, the commission may consider, as appropriate, the cost of flexible demand appliances compared to nonflexible demand appliances, the value of increased or decreased emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the timing of an appliance&#39;s use, the life-cycle cost to the consumer from using a product that complies with the standard, and the life-cycle costs and benefits to consumers, including the ability to conserve energy and better align consumer and electric system demand. The commission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code, including, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and alternative approaches and their associated costs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) The commission shall consult with the Public Utilities Commission, load-serving entities, and local publicly owned electric utilities to better align the flexible demand appliance standards with demand response programs administered by the state and load-serving entities and local publicly owned electric utilities and to incentivize the deployment of flexible demand appliances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) The flexible demand appliance standards shall prioritize all of the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Appliances that can more conveniently have their electrical demand controlled by load-management technology and third-party load-management programs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Appliances with load-management technology options that are readily available.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Appliances that have a user-friendly interface and follow a straightforward setup and connection process, such as remote setup by means of an internet website or application.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Appliances with load-management technology options that follow simple standards for third-party direct operation of the appliances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(E) Appliances that are interoperable or open source.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) On or before January 1, 2021, and as necessary thereafter, the commission shall include as part of each integrated energy policy report adopted pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 25300) a description of any actions it has taken pursuant to this subdivision and the flexible demand appliance standards&#39; cost to consumers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) For purposes of this subdivision, all of the following definitions apply:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) &quot;Flexible demand&quot; means the capability to schedule, shift, or curtail the electrical demand of a load-serving entity&#39;s customer or a local publicly owned electric utility&#39;s customer through direct action by the customer or through action by a third party, the load-serving entity, or a grid balancing authority, with the customer&#39;s consent.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) &quot;Load-serving entity&quot; has the same meaning as defined in Section 380 of the Public Utilities Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) &quot;Local publicly owned electric utility&quot; has the same meaning as defined in Section 224.3 of the Public Utilities Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SEC. 3. Section 451.4 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">451.4. (a) For purposes of this section, &quot;data center&quot; has the same meaning as defined in Section 25345 of the Public Resources Code.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) In an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and expenses arising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new data center or a substantial alteration to an existing data center, the commission shall determine whether those costs and expenses are just and reasonable in accordance with Section 451.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) In determining whether costs and expenses are just and reasonable pursuant to subdivision (b), the commission shall minimize the shifting of costs attributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to ratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

The bill would also require a developer, on or before February 1,\n2027, and annually thereafter, to estimate the total energy used by the\ndeveloper to operate the covered model during the previous calendar year and\nthe percentage of the estimated total energy that was generated in California.\nThe bill would require the developer to publish on its internet website that\nenergy usage data, as provided.\n\nExisting law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development\nCommission (Energy Commission) to biennially adopt an integrated energy policy\nreport, as specified, and to make the reports accessible to state, local, and\nfederal entities and to the general public.~~Existing law requires the Energy\nCommission to prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design\nstandards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings, as provided.~~\n\nThis bill would require the Energy Commission to include energy consumption\ntrends for data centers in its integrated energy policy reports.~~The bill\nwould require the Energy Commission, on or before January 1, 2027, to adopt\nefficiency standards for data centers, as provided.~~\n\nExisting law vests the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) with regulatory\nauthority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing\nlaw authorizes the PUC to fix the rates and charges for every public utility,\nand requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.\n\nThis bill would require the PUC to determine whether those costs and expenses\nin an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and expenses\narising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new data\ncenter or a substantial alteration to an existing data center are just and\nreasonable. The bill would require the PUC to minimize the shifting of costs\nattributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to\nratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.\n\nVote: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. Chapter 4.4 (commencing with Section 25345) is added to Division 15\nof the Public Resources Code, to read:\n\nCHAPTER 4.4. Data Center Modeling and Energy-Usage Reporting\n\n25345\\. For purposes of this chapter, all of the following definitions apply:\n\n(a) \"Artificial intelligence\" or \"AI\" means an engineered or machine-based\nsystem that varies in its level of autonomy and that can, for explicit or\nimplicit objectives, infer from the input it receives how to generate outputs\nthat can influence physical or virtual environments.\n\n(b) \"Computer room\" means a room within a building whose primary function is\nto house electronic equipment and that has a design information technology\nequipment power density exceeding 20 watts per square foot or 215 watts per\nsquare meters of conditioned floor area.\n\n(c) \"Covered model\" means an AI model developed using a quantity of computing\npower exceeding 10^25 integer or floating-point operations.\n\n(d) \"Data center\" means a building the primary function of which is to house\none or more computer rooms with an energy demand of at least 5 megawatts.\n\n(e) \"Developer\" means a person, partnership, state or local government agency,\nor corporation that designs, codes, trains, or otherwise produces a covered\nmodel.\n\n(f) \"Information Technology Equipment\" includes computers, data storage,\nservers, and network or communication equipment located in a computer room.\n\n25345.1. (a) Before using a covered model commercially, or before making a\ncovered model available for use by a third party, a developer shall do both of\nthe following:\n\n(1) Estimate both of the following:\n\n(A) The total energy, in megawatthours, used to develop the covered model.\n\n(B) The percentage of total energy used to develop the covered model that was\ngenerated in California.\n\n(2) Publish the energy usage data estimated pursuant to paragraph (1) on the\ndeveloper's internet website.\n\n(b) On or before February 1, 2027, and annually thereafter, a developer shall\ndo both of the following:\n\n(1) Estimate both of the following:\n\n(A) The total energy, in megawatthours, used by the developer to operate the\ncovered model during the previous calendar year.\n\n(B) The percentage of the total energy estimated pursuant to subparagraph (A)\nthat was generated in California.\n\n(2) Publish the energy usage data estimated pursuant to paragraph (1) on the\ndeveloper's internet website.\n\n(c) Energy usage data published pursuant to this section shall be all of the\nfollowing:\n\n(1) Publicly available for as long as the developer continues to use the\ncovered model or continues to make the covered model available for use by a\nthird party.\n\n(2) Provided at no cost to a user of the developer's internet website.\n\n(3) Accessible and comprehensible to a natural person with ordinary cognitive\nabilities.\n\nSEC. 2. Section 25402 of the Public Resources Code is amended to read:\n\n25402\\. The commission shall, after one or more public hearings, do all of the\nfollowing to reduce the wasteful, uneconomic, inefficient, or unnecessary\nconsumption of energy, including the energy associated with the use of water,\nand to manage energy loads to help maintain electrical grid reliability:\n\n(a) (1) Prescribe, by regulation, lighting, insulation, climate control\nsystem, and other building design and construction standards that increase\nefficiency in the use of energy and water for new residential and new\nnonresidential buildings. The commission shall periodically update the\nstandards and adopt any revision that, in its judgment, it deems necessary.\nSix months after the commission certifies an energy conservation manual\npursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 25402.1, a city, county, city and\ncounty, or state agency shall not issue a permit for a building unless the\nbuilding satisfies the standards prescribed by the commission pursuant to this\nsubdivision or subdivision (b) that are in effect on the date an application\nfor a building permit is filed. Water efficiency standards adopted pursuant to\nthis subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission to be necessary to\nsave energy.\n\n(2) Before adopting a water efficiency standard for residential buildings, the\nDepartment of Housing and Community Development and the commission shall issue\na joint finding whether the standard (A) is equivalent or superior in\nperformance, in safety, and for the protection of life, health, and general\nwelfare to standards in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations and (B)\ndoes not unreasonably or unnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to\npurchase or rent affordable housing, as determined by taking account of the\noverall benefit derived from water efficiency standards. This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(3) Water efficiency standards and water conservation design standards adopted\npursuant to this subdivision and subdivision (b) shall be consistent with the\nlegislative findings of this division to ensure and maintain a reliable supply\nof electrical energy and be equivalent to or superior to the performance,\nsafety, and protection of life, health, and general welfare standards\ncontained in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. The commission\nshall consult with the members of the coordinating council as established in\nSection 18926 of the Health and Safety Code in the development of these\nstandards.\n\n(b) (1) Prescribe, by regulation, energy and water conservation design\nstandards for new residential and new nonresidential buildings. The standards\nshall be performance standards and shall be promulgated in terms of energy\nconsumption per gross square foot of floorspace, but may also include devices,\nsystems, and techniques required to conserve energy and water. The commission\nshall periodically review the standards and adopt any revision that, in its\njudgment, it deems necessary. A building that satisfies the standards\nprescribed pursuant to this subdivision need not comply with the standards\nprescribed pursuant to subdivision (a). Water conservation design standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision shall be demonstrated by the commission\nto be necessary to save energy. Before adopting a water conservation design\nstandard for residential buildings, the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment and the commission shall issue a joint finding whether the\nstandard (A) is equivalent or superior in performance, in safety, and for the\nprotection of life, health, and general welfare to standards in Title 24 of\nthe California Code of Regulations, and (B) does not unreasonably or\nunnecessarily impact the ability of Californians to purchase or rent\naffordable housing, as determined by taking account of the overall benefit\nderived from the water conservation design standards. This subdivision does\nnot in any way reduce the authority of the Department of Housing and Community\nDevelopment to adopt standards and regulations pursuant to the State Housing\nLaw (Part 1.5 (commencing with Section 17910) of Division 13 of the Health and\nSafety Code).\n\n(2) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to subdivision (a) and this subdivision, the commission\nshall, before publication of the notice of proposed action required by Section\n18935 of the Health and Safety Code, involve parties who would be subject to\nthe proposed regulations in public meetings regarding the proposed\nregulations. All potential affected parties shall be provided advance notice\nof these meetings and given an opportunity to provide written or oral\ncomments. During these public meetings, the commission shall receive and take\ninto consideration input from all parties concerning the parties' design\nrecommendations, cost considerations, and other factors that would affect\nconsumers and California businesses of the proposed standard. The commission\nshall take into consideration before the start of the notice of proposed\naction any input provided during these public meetings.\n\n(3) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to subdivision (a) and this\nsubdivision shall be cost effective when taken in their entirety and when\namortized over the economic life of the structure compared with historic\npractice. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission shall consider\nthe value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product efficacy for the\nconsumer, and the life-cycle cost of complying with the standard. The\ncommission shall consider other relevant factors, as required by Sections\n18930 and 18935 of the Health and Safety Code, including, but not limited to,\nthe impact on housing costs, the total statewide costs and benefits of the\nstandard over its lifetime, the economic impact on California businesses, and\nany alternative approaches and their associated costs.\n\n(4) (A) For purposes of this paragraph, \"data center\" has the same meaning as\ndefined in Section 25345.\n\n~~(B) On or before January 1, 2027, the commission shall adopt efficiency\nstandards for data centers that do all of the following:~~\n\n~~(i) Be technologically feasible and cost effective.~~\n\n~~(ii) Align with California 's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.~~\n\n~~(iii) Require new data centers and substantial alterations to existing data\ncenters to incorporate load-management and load-shifting capabilities,\nincluding the ability to participate in demand response programs.~~\n\n~~(C)~~\n\n_(B)_ Before initially operating as a data center and following any change\nthat materially affects the correctness of information previously provided to\nthe commission, a data center shall report all of the following information to\nthe commission:\n\n(i) The name of the data center.\n\n(ii) Any physical addresses associated with the operation of the data center.\n\n(iii) The internet website of the data center if the data center has an\ninternet website.\n\n(iv) A telephone number and email address for a point of contact for the\ncommission to communicate with the data center.\n\n~~(D)~~\n\n_(C)_ The commission shall include energy consumption trends for data centers\nin its integrated energy policy report prepared pursuant to Section 25302.\n\n(c) (1) (A) (i) Prescribe, by regulation, standards for minimum levels of\noperating efficiency, based on a reasonable use pattern, and may prescribe\nother cost-effective measures, including incentive programs, fleet averaging,\nenergy and water consumption labeling not preempted by federal labeling law,\nand consumer education programs, to promote the use of energy- and water-\nefficient appliances whose use, as determined by the commission, requires a\nsignificant amount of energy or water on a statewide basis. The minimum levels\nof operating efficiency shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies\nor feasible improved efficiencies that will reduce the energy or water\nconsumption growth rates. The standards for minimum levels of operating\nefficiency shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\nadoption or revision, unless the commission adopts a finding of good cause in\nwhich case the standards may become effective sooner than one year after the\ndate of adoption or revision. A new appliance manufactured on or after the\neffective date of the standards or other cost-effective measures shall not be\nsold or offered for sale in the state, unless it is certified by the\nmanufacturer of the appliance to be in compliance with the standards or other\ncost-effective measures. The standards or other cost-effective measures shall\nbe drawn so that they do not result in any added total costs for consumers\nover the designed life of the appliances concerned. \"Sold or offered for sale\nin the state\" means any sale of or offer to sell an appliance for end use in\nthe state, regardless of the seller's physical location, and includes, without\nlimitation, internet, telephone, and mail order transactions. For purposes of\nthis section, the Uniform Commercial Code-Sales (Division 2 (commencing with\nSection 2101) of the Commercial Code) does not define \"sold or offered for\nsale\" or determine where sales or offers for sale occur.\n\n(ii) In making a finding of good cause for purposes of a standard becoming\neffective sooner than one year after the date of adoption or revision pursuant\nto clause (i), the commission shall consider, among other things, the\nfollowing factors:\n\n(I) The availability of products on the market that meet the proposed\nstandard.\n\n(II) The impact of an earlier effective date on manufacturers.\n\n(III) The health and safety benefits of an earlier effective date.\n\n(IV) The impact on innovation resulting from a one-year delay between the date\nof adoption or revision and the effective date of the standard.\n\n(V) The concerns raised by comments, provided to the commission pursuant to\nsubparagraph (B), for an earlier effective date.\n\n(B) To increase public participation and improve the efficacy of the standards\nadopted pursuant to this subdivision, the commission shall, before publication\nof the notice of proposed action required by Section 18935 of the Health and\nSafety Code, involve parties who would be subject to the proposed regulations\nin public meetings regarding the proposed regulations. All potential affected\nparties shall be provided advance notice of these meetings and given an\nopportunity to provide written or oral comments. During these public meetings,\nthe commission shall receive and take into consideration input from all\nparties concerning the parties' design recommendations, cost considerations,\nand other factors that would affect consumers and California businesses of the\nproposed standard. The commission shall take into consideration before the\nstart of the notice of proposed action any input provided during these public\nmeetings.\n\n(C) The standards adopted or revised pursuant to this subdivision shall not\nresult in any added total costs for consumers over the designed life of the\nappliances concerned. When determining cost-effectiveness, the commission\nshall consider the value of the water or energy saved, the impact on product\nefficacy for the consumer, and the life-cycle cost to the consumer of\ncomplying with the standard. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and any alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(2) A new appliance, except for a plumbing fitting, regulated under paragraph\n(1), that is manufactured on or after July 1, 1984, shall not be sold, or\noffered for sale, in the state, unless the date of the manufacture is\npermanently displayed in an accessible place on that appliance.\n\n(3) During the period of five years after the commission has adopted a\nstandard for a particular appliance under paragraph (1), an increase or\ndecrease in the minimum level of operating efficiency required by the standard\nfor that appliance shall not become effective, unless the commission adopts\nother cost-effective measures for that appliance.\n\n(4) Neither the commission nor any other state agency shall take any action to\ndecrease any standard adopted under this subdivision on or before June 30,\n1985, prescribing minimum levels of operating efficiency or other energy\nconservation measures for any appliance, unless the commission finds by a\nfour-fifths vote that a decrease is of benefit to ratepayers, and that there\nis significant evidence of changed circumstances. At least one year before the\nadoption or amendment of a standard for an appliance, the commission shall\nnotify the Legislature of its intent, and the justification to adopt or amend\na standard for the appliance. Notwithstanding paragraph (3) and this\nparagraph, the commission may do any of the following:\n\n(A) Increase the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nup to the level of the National Voluntary Consensus Standards 90, adopted by\nthe American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers\nor, for appliances not covered by that standard, up to the level established\nin a similar nationwide consensus standard.\n\n(B) Change the measure or rating of efficiency of any standard, if the minimum\nlevel of operating efficiency remains substantially the same.\n\n(C) Adjust the minimum level of operating efficiency in an existing standard\nto reflect changes in test procedures that the standards require manufacturers\nto use in certifying compliance, if the minimum level of operating efficiency\nremains substantially the same.\n\n(D) Readopt a standard preempted, enjoined, or otherwise found legally\ndefective by an administrative agency or a lower court, if final legal action\ndetermines that the standard is valid and if the standard that is readopted is\nnot more stringent than the standard that was found to be defective or\npreempted.\n\n(E) Adopt or amend any existing or new standard at any level of operating\nefficiency, if the Governor has declared an energy emergency as described in\nSection 8558 of the Government Code.\n\n(d) Recommend minimum standards of efficiency for the operation of a new\nfacility at a particular site that are technically and economically feasible.\nA site and related facility shall not be certified pursuant to Chapter 6\n(commencing with Section 25500), unless the applicant certifies that standards\nrecommended by the commission have been considered, which certification shall\ninclude a statement specifying the extent to which conformance with the\nrecommended standards will be achieved.\n\n(e) (1) Adopt, by regulation, and periodically update, standards for\nappliances to facilitate the deployment of flexible demand technologies. These\nregulations may include labeling provisions to promote the use of appliances\nwith flexible demand capabilities. The flexible demand appliance standards\nshall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies or feasible\nimprovements that will enable appliance operations to be scheduled, shifted,\nor curtailed to enhance grid reliability, reduce emissions of greenhouse gases\nassociated with electricity generation, or both enhancement and reduction. The\nstandards shall become effective no sooner than one year after the date of\ntheir adoption or updating.\n\n(2) In adopting the flexible demand appliance standards, the commission shall\nconsider the National Institute of Standards and Technology's reliability and\ncybersecurity protocols, or other cybersecurity protocols that are equally or\nmore protective, and shall adopt, at a minimum, the North American Electric\nReliability Corporation's Critical Infrastructure Protection standards.\n\n(3) The flexible demand appliance standards shall be cost effective. When\ndetermining cost-effectiveness, solely for purposes of this subdivision, the\ncommission may consider, as appropriate, the cost of flexible demand\nappliances compared to nonflexible demand appliances, the value of increased\nor decreased emissions of greenhouse gases associated with the timing of an\nappliance's use, the life-cycle cost to the consumer from using a product that\ncomplies with the standard, and the life-cycle costs and benefits to\nconsumers, including the ability to conserve energy and better align consumer\nand electric system demand. The commission shall consider other relevant\nfactors, as required by Sections 11346.5 and 11357 of the Government Code,\nincluding, but not limited to, the impact on housing costs, the total\nstatewide costs and benefits of the standard over its lifetime, the economic\nimpact on California businesses, and alternative approaches and their\nassociated costs.\n\n(4) The commission shall consult with the Public Utilities Commission, load-\nserving entities, and local publicly owned electric utilities to better align\nthe flexible demand appliance standards with demand response programs\nadministered by the state and load-serving entities and local publicly owned\nelectric utilities and to incentivize the deployment of flexible demand\nappliances.\n\n(5) The flexible demand appliance standards shall prioritize all of the\nfollowing:\n\n(A) Appliances that can more conveniently have their electrical demand\ncontrolled by load-management technology and third-party load-management\nprograms.\n\n(B) Appliances with load-management technology options that are readily\navailable.\n\n(C) Appliances that have a user-friendly interface and follow a\nstraightforward setup and connection process, such as remote setup by means of\nan internet website or application.\n\n(D) Appliances with load-management technology options that follow simple\nstandards for third-party direct operation of the appliances.\n\n(E) Appliances that are interoperable or open source.\n\n(6) On or before January 1, 2021, and as necessary thereafter, the commission\nshall include as part of each integrated energy policy report adopted pursuant\nto Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 25300) a description of any actions it\nhas taken pursuant to this subdivision and the flexible demand appliance\nstandards' cost to consumers.\n\n(7) For purposes of this subdivision, all of the following definitions apply:\n\n(A) \"Flexible demand\" means the capability to schedule, shift, or curtail the\nelectrical demand of a load-serving entity's customer or a local publicly\nowned electric utility's customer through direct action by the customer or\nthrough action by a third party, the load-serving entity, or a grid balancing\nauthority, with the customer's consent.\n\n(B) \"Load-serving entity\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 380 of\nthe Public Utilities Code.\n\n(C) \"Local publicly owned electric utility\" has the same meaning as defined in\nSection 224.3 of the Public Utilities Code.\n\nSEC. 3. Section 451.4 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:\n\n451.4. (a) For purposes of this section, \"data center\" has the same meaning as\ndefined in Section 25345 of the Public Resources Code.\n\n(b) In an application by an electrical corporation to recover costs and\nexpenses arising from, or incurred as a result of, the construction of a new\ndata center or a substantial alteration to an existing data center, the\ncommission shall determine whether those costs and expenses are just and\nreasonable in accordance with Section 451.\n\n(c) In determining whether costs and expenses are just and reasonable pursuant\nto subdivision (b), the commission shall minimize the shifting of costs\nattributable to the construction or alteration of the data center to\nratepayers who do not directly benefit from the data center.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
