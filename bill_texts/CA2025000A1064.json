The act would require, on or before January 1, 2028, the board to adopt regulations governing, among other things, criteria for determining the level of estimated risk of a covered product based on an analysis that weighs the likelihood and severity of reasonably foreseeable adverse impacts against the anticipated benefits of the covered product and denominating the risk levels, as prescribed. The act would define &quot;covered product&quot; to mean an artificial intelligence system that is intended to, or highly likely to, be used by children, used to process a child&#39;s personal information, or applied directly to a child, but the bill would also require the board to adopt regulations governing criteria for developers to determine if an artificial intelligence system is a covered product.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The act would, among other things, require, on or before July 1, 2028, a developer to do certain things with respect to a covered product, including preparing and submitting to the board any risk level assessment required by regulation in order to determine the appropriate risk classification of the covered product. The act would authorize the board to refer violations of the act to the Attorney General and would authorize the Attorney General to recover a certain civil penalty, as prescribed. The act would authorize a child who suffers actual harm as a result of the use of a<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> high risk or prohibited risk</u> covered product, or a parent or guardian acting on behalf of that child, to bring a civil action to recover, among other relief, actual damages.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The act would create in the State Treasury the LEAD for Kids AI Fund into which any civil penalty recovered by the Attorney General pursuant to the act is deposited and would make the moneys in the fund available, only upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of administering the act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for\nKids Act.\n\nThe California AI Transparency Act requires a person that creates, codes, or\notherwise produces a generative artificial intelligence system that has over\n1,000,000 monthly visitors or users and is publicly accessible within the\ngeographic boundaries of the state to make available an AI detection tool at\nno cost to the user that, among other things, allows a user to assess whether\nimage, video, or audio content, or content that is any combination thereof,\nwas created or altered by the covered provider's generative artificial\nintelligence system.\n\nThis bill, the Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for Kids Act, would\nestablish, and provide for the membership of, the LEAD for Kids Standards\nBoard in the Government Operations Agency and require the Governor to appoint\nan executive officer of the board, subject to Senate confirmation, who would\nhold the office at the pleasure of the Governor. The act would require, on or\nbefore January 1, 2028, the board to adopt regulations governing, among other\nthings, criteria for determining the level of estimated risk of a covered\nproduct based on an analysis that weighs the likelihood and severity of\nreasonably foreseeable adverse impacts against the anticipated benefits of the\ncovered product and denominating the risk levels, as prescribed. The act would\ndefine \"covered product\" to mean an artificial intelligence system that is\nintended to, or highly likely to, be used by children, used to process a\nchild's personal information, or applied directly to a child, but the bill\nwould also require the board to adopt regulations governing criteria for\ndevelopers to determine if an artificial intelligence system is a covered\nproduct.\n\nThe act would, among other things, require, on or before July 1, 2028, a\ndeveloper to do certain things with respect to a covered product, including\npreparing and submitting to the board any risk level assessment required by\nregulation in order to determine the appropriate risk classification of the\ncovered product. The act would authorize the board to refer violations of the\nact to the Attorney General and would authorize the Attorney General to\nrecover a certain civil penalty, as prescribed. The act would authorize a\nchild who suffers actual harm as a result of the use of a _high risk or\nprohibited risk_ covered product, or a parent or guardian acting on behalf of\nthat child, to bring a civil action to recover, among other relief, actual\ndamages.\n\nThe act would create in the State Treasury the LEAD for Kids AI Fund into\nwhich any civil penalty recovered by the Attorney General pursuant to the act\nis deposited and would make the moneys in the fund available, only upon\nappropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of administering the act.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.
