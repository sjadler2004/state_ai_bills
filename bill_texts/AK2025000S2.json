Each state agency shall\nassist the department as necessary.\n\nAn inventory must include, at a minimum, the following information for each\nsystem:\n\n(1) the name of the system;\n\n(2) the vendor that provides the system, if any;\n\n(3) a description of the general capabilities and uses of the system;\n\n(4) whether the state agency completed an impact assessment of the system\nunder AS 44.99.710 before the system's implementation; and\n\n(5) the date of completion of the most recent state agency impact assessment\nof the system under AS 44.99.710.\n\n(b) The department shall remove from the inventory a system that is no longer\nused by a state agency.\n\n(c) The department shall publish each inventory on the department's Internet\nwebsite.\n\n**Sec. 44.99.710. Impact assessments.** (a) At least once every two years, the\nhead of a state agency that uses a system that employs generative artificial\nintelligence for consequential decisions shall conduct an impact assessment of\nthe system. An impact assessment must include, at a minimum, an analysis of\n\n(1) the efficacy of the system;\n\n(2) the human oversight involved in the system;\n\n(3) the accountability mechanisms in place for the system;\n\n(4) the process by which an individual may appeal a decision made or\nfacilitated by the system;\n\n(5) the current and potential benefits, liability, and risks to the state from\nthe system, including risks related to cybersecurity and intellectual property\nand any measures used to mitigate liability and risks;\n\n(6) the current and potential effects of the system on the liberty, finances,\nlivelihood, and privacy interests of individuals in the state, including\neffects from any use of geolocation data by the system;\n\n(7) any unlawful discrimination against or unlawful disparate impact on an\nindividual or a group of individuals that has resulted or may result from the\nsystem; and\n\n(8) the policies and procedures that govern the process of using the system\nfor consequential decisions.\n\n(b) A state agency that completes an impact assessment shall provide the\nassessment to the department, and the head of the agency shall consult with\nthe commissioner of administration to determine future use of the system by\nthe agency.\n\n**Sec. 44.99.720. Requirements for use of artificial intelligence by state\nagencies.** (a) A state agency that uses a system that employs generative\nartificial intelligence for consequential decisions shall\n\n(1) notify each individual who may be legally or significantly affected by the\nuse of the system;\n\n(2) obtain an individual's consent before soliciting or acquiring sensitive\npersonal data from or about the individual that will be used by the system;\n\n(3) provide an appeals process that includes manual human review for an\nindividual who is legally or significantly affected by the use of the system;\nand\n\n(4) inform a prospective employee of the state agency about any video\ninterview that involves the use of generative artificial intelligence and\nobtain the prospective employee's consent before employing generative\nartificial intelligence.\n\n(b) A state agency may not use a system that employs artificial intelligence\nfor consequential decisions if the system involves\n\n(1) biometric identification, including facial recognition;\n\n(2) emotion recognition;\n\n(3) cognitive behavioral manipulation of individuals or groups; or\n\n(4) social scoring.\n\n(c) A state agency may not use a system that employs artificial intelligence\nfor consequential decisions if the system uses data hosted in a country\ndesignated by regulation as a foreign adversary.\n\n(d) A state agency may contract with a person for a system that employs\nartificial intelligence for consequential decisions only if the person has\nimplemented security and privacy controls as specified by the National\nInstitute of Standards and Technology in Special Publication 800-53, Revision\n5, published in September 2020 or in regulations adopted by the department\ndesignating a publication revising or superseding Special Publication 800-53.\n\n**Sec. 44.99.730.

Regulations.** (a) The department shall adopt regulations\nunder AS 44.62 (Administrative Procedure Act) concerning the development,\nprocurement, implementation, use, and ongoing assessment of systems that\nemploy generative artificial intelligence by state agencies for consequential\ndecisions. The regulations must include, at a minimum, provisions that\n\n(1) govern the procurement, implementation, and ongoing assessment of each\nsystem;\n\n(2) require a state agency to conduct an impact assessment of each system\nunder AS 44.99.710 before its implementation;\n\n(3) ensure that a system does not result in unlawful discrimination or an\nunlawful disparate impact on an individual or a group of individuals;\n\n(4) provide for the ongoing assessment of each system; and\n\n(5) designate countries that constitute foreign adversaries, considering\ndeterminations made by the United States.\n\n(b) The department may adopt additional regulations under AS 44.62\n(Administrative Procedure Act) necessary to implement AS 44.99.700 -\n44.99.730.\n\n**Sec. 44.99.750.
