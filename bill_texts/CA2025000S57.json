Data centers:~~rates.~~ _tariff._\n\nExisting law vests the Public Utilities Commission with regulatory authority\nover public utilities, including electrical corporations. Existing law\nauthorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public\nutility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.\n\nThis bill, the Ratepayer and Technological Innovation Protection Act, would\nrequire the commission, on or before July 1, 2026, to establish a\nspecial~~rate structure~~ _electrical corporation tariff_ for _transmission\nand distribution service to_ data centers, as defined, that, among other\nthings,~~protects residential ratepayers~~ _provides protections for\nresidential, agricultural,_ and small~~businesses~~ _business ratepayers_ and\nprevents cost shifts to those existing ratepayers and ensures electrical grid\ninvestments to serve data centers are fully~~recovered,~~ _recovered from the\ndata center,_ as specified._The bill would require that 100% of all\nelectricity delivered to data centers is provided by zero-carbon resources on\nor before January 1, 2030, as provided. The bill would require the commission\nto require that all load-serving entities comply with that requirement and to\nensure that electrical corporations offer tariffs that comply with that\nrequirement._\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order,\ndecision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a\ncrime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a\nviolation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be\na crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Ratepayer and\nTechnological Innovation Protection Act.\n\nSEC. 2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(1) California drives worldwide technological innovation, and that innovation\nis an important component of the state's economy, which is the fifth largest\neconomy in the world.\n\n(2) California supports technological innovation with a world-class university\nsystem that provides a highly skilled workforce, and research and development\ntax incentives and other tools to facilitate the development and expansion of\nthe state's technology economy.\n\n(3) The quickly evolving development of artificial intelligence requires\nlarge-format data centers that currently require extremely large loads of\nelectricity and water. While that expanded energy demand can help support the\nlarger electrical grid and ordinary ratepayers, if managed incorrectly, it\ncould pose a serious threat to California's climate goals and, more\nimportantly, leave existing ratepayers saddled with the enormous costs of\nstranded assets built to support that industry.\n\n(b) Given the large-scale impact to California's electrical grid posed by the\ndevelopment of new technologies, coupled with the need to help support this\nexpanding industry, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Public\nUtilities Commission create a special tariff system to protect existing\nratepayers and clean energy standards, while providing faster and more\nefficient approval for new load interconnections to support this emerging\ntechnological revolution.\n\nSEC. 3. Section 740.22 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:\n\n740.22. (a) On or before July 1, 2026, the commission shall establish a\nspecial~~rate structure~~ _electrical corporation tariff_ for _transmission\nand distribution service to_ data centers that does all of the following, each\nof which independently justifies the program:\n\n(1) ~~Protects residential ratepayers~~ _Provides protections for residential,\nagricultural,_ and small~~businesses~~ _business ratepayers_ and prevents cost\nshifts to those existing ratepayers.\n\n(2) Assists each electrical corporation with fulfilling its obligation to\nserve its customers at just and reasonable rates.\n\n(3) ~~Decreases~~ _Does not increase_ fossil fuel consumption within the\nstate.\n\n(4) Reduces air pollution in the state.\n\n(5) Meets the state's climate change goals by reducing the emissions of\ngreenhouse gases associated with electrical generation.\n\n(6) Promotes stable retail rates for electrical service.\n\n(7) Contributes to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical grid,\nincluding by providing predictable electrical supply, voltage support, lower\nline losses, and congestion relief.\n\n(8) Permits qualified data centers to use a reasonable percentage of behind-\nthe-meter electricity that is generated as zero carbon, and requires backup\ngeneration that includes energy storage.\n\n(9) Requires onsite battery storage that provides demand response services to\nthe electrical grid.\n\n(10) (A) Ensures electrical grid investments to serve data centers are\nfully~~recovered,~~ _recovered from the data center,_ which, at minimum,\nincludes a 12-year binding _transmission and distribution service_ contract\nto~~purchase its projected electrical load~~ _repay the electrical corporation\n's transmission and distribution investment costs to serve the data center,_\nand requires an insurance bond to pay the remainder of the contracted amount\nshould the data center cease operations in California or use less electricity\nthan initially projected and relied upon to build out the electrical grid.\n\n(B) A contract under subparagraph (A) may include an \"exit fee\" that is equal\nto the cost of the~~data center 's projected electrical load~~ _electrical\ncorporation 's transmission and distribution investment_ costs _to serve the\ndata center and_ that gives the data center customer a way to terminate the\ncontract before the end of the initial 12-year term.\n\n~~(11) Develops a process through which data center operators can prepay\nexpected energy consumption to accelerate necessary electrical grid\ninvestments and accelerate electrical grid interconnection timelines.~~\n\n_(11) Requires a data center to prepay an electrical corporation for the cost\nof any necessary transmission or distribution infrastructure upgrades in\nexchange for the electrical corporation providing more expedited construction\nof that infrastructure, and provides for the data center to be reimbursed for\nany portion of the prepayment relating to costs for which the data center\nwould not otherwise be responsible through a monthly credit on the data center\n's bill over a reasonable period of time determined by the commission._\n\n_(12) For data centers taking transmission-level delivery service, collects a\nreasonable share of the costs relating to wildfire mitigation, wildfire\nliability, electrification and environmental programs, and other societal cost\nobligations typically included in distribution rates._\n\n_(b) On or before January 1, 2030, 100 percent of all electricity delivered to\ndata centers shall be provided by zero-carbon resources in a manner that does\nnot result in resource shuffling and does not increase carbon emissions\nelsewhere in the western grid. The commission shall require all load-serving\nentities to comply with that requirement and ensure that each electrical\ncorporation offers a tariff that complies with that requirement._\n\n~~(b)~~\n\n_(c)_ For purposes of this section,~~ \"data~~ _both of the following\ndefinitions apply:_\n\n_(1) \"Data_ center\" means a large-scale energy consumer that requires\nuninterruptible electricity to serve a facility housing servers and related\ndata center equipment and software for the processing, storage, and\ndistribution of data.\n\n_(2) \"Load-serving entity\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 380._\n\nSEC. 4. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of\nArticle XIIIB of the California Constitution because the only costs that may\nbe incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this\nact creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or\nchanges the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section\n17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the\nmeaning of Section 6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",

The bill would require\nthe commission to require that all load-serving entities comply with that\nrequirement and to ensure that electrical corporations offer tariffs that\ncomply with that requirement.~~ _the commission, on or before January 1, 2030,\nto require all retail sellers subject to its jurisdiction to serve any data\ncenter subject to the tariff or program with electricity from 100% zero-carbon\nresources in a manner that does not result in resource shuffling and does not\nincrease carbon emissions elsewhere in the western grid._\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order,\ndecision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a\ncrime.\n\nBecause the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because a\nviolation of a commission action implementing the bill's requirements would be\na crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

While that expanded energy demand can help support the\nlarger electrical grid and ordinary ratepayers, if managed incorrectly, it\ncould pose a serious threat to California's climate goals and, more\nimportantly, leave existing ratepayers saddled with the enormous costs of\nstranded assets built to support that industry._Furthermore, with the\nappropriate guardrails, the increased consumption from these large-load\ncustomers could help drive down electricity rates for existing utility\ncustomers._\n\n_(4) More efficient use of existing electrical and grid assets and the sharing\nof fixed energy costs across a larger overall demand can lower the cost to\nindividual customers as a result of a new data center development._\n\n(b) Given the large-scale impact to California's electrical grid posed by the\ndevelopment of new technologies, coupled with the need to help support this\nexpanding industry, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Public\nUtilities Commission~~create~~ _authorize_ a special tariff system to protect\nexisting ratepayers and clean energy standards, while providing faster and\nmore efficient approval for new load interconnections to support this emerging\ntechnological revolution.\n\nSEC. 3.

Existing law\nauthorizes the commission to fix the rates and charges for every public\nutility and requires that those rates and charges be just and reasonable.\n\nThis bill, the Ratepayer and Technological Innovation Protection Act, would\nrequire the commission, on or before July 1, 2026, to establish _or modify_ a\nspecial electrical corporation tariff~~or program, or modify an existing\ntariff or program,~~ for transmission and distribution service to~~data\ncenters,~~ _eligible customers,_ as defined, that, among other things,~~avoids\nnonparticipating customers, such as existing residential, small business, and\nagricultural ratepayers, bearing cost shifts, such as the costs of\ninterconnecting facilities or loads that fall short of initial projections and\nensures electrical grid investments to serve a data center are fully recovered\nfrom the data center in the event that the data center ceases operations or\nuses less electricity than initially projected. The bill would require the\ncommission, on or before January 1, 2030, to require all retail sellers\nsubject to its jurisdiction to serve any data center subject to the tariff or\nprogram with electricity from 100% zero-carbon resources in a manner that does\nnot result in resource shuffling and does not increase carbon emissions\nelsewhere in the western grid.~~ _ensures just and reasonable rates for\ncustomers of electrical corporations and does not result in cost shifts to\ncustomers who do not receive the tariff. The bill would authorize the\ncommission to require an eligible customer to site distributed energy storage\nsystems and backup power systems that better enable the state to meet its\nemission reduction goals. The bill would authorize the commission to establish\nminimum requirements for zero-carbon procurement on behalf of retail sellers\nfor eligible customers receiving the tariff._\n\nUnder existing law, a violation of~~the Public Utilities Act or~~ any order,\ndecision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a\ncrime.\n\nBecause~~the provisions of this bill would be a part of the act and because~~\na violation of a commission action implementing~~the~~ _this_ bill's\nrequirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local\nprogram.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a\nspecified reason.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. This act shall be known, and may be cited, as the Ratepayer and\nTechnological Innovation Protection Act.\n\nSEC. 2. (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(1) California drives worldwide technological innovation, and that innovation\nis an important component of the state's economy, which is the fifth largest\neconomy in the world.\n\n(2) California supports technological innovation with a world-class university\nsystem that provides a highly skilled workforce, and research and development\ntax incentives and other tools to facilitate the development and expansion of\nthe state's technology economy.\n\n(3) The quickly evolving development of artificial intelligence requires\nlarge-format data centers that currently require extremely large loads of\nelectricity and water. While that expanded energy demand can help support the\nlarger electrical grid and ordinary ratepayers, if managed incorrectly, it\ncould pose a serious threat to California's climate goals and, more\nimportantly, leave existing ratepayers saddled with the enormous costs of\nstranded assets built to support that industry. Furthermore, with the\nappropriate guardrails, the increased consumption from these large-load\ncustomers could help drive down electricity rates for existing utility\ncustomers.\n\n(4) More efficient use of existing electrical and grid assets and the sharing\nof fixed energy costs across a larger overall demand can lower the cost to\nindividual customers as a result of a new data center development.\n\n(b) Given the large-scale impact to California's electrical grid posed by the\ndevelopment of new technologies, coupled with the need to help support this\nexpanding industry, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Public\nUtilities Commission authorize a special tariff system to protect existing\nratepayers and clean energy standards, while providing faster and more\nefficient approval for new load interconnections to support this emerging\ntechnological revolution.\n\nSEC. 3. Section 740.22 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:\n\n740.22. (a) On or before July 1, 2026, the commission shall establish _or\nmodify_ a special electrical corporation tariff~~or program, or modify and\nexisting tariff or program,~~ for transmission and distribution service\nto~~data centers that~~ _eligible customers that, at minimum,_ does all of the\nfollowing:\n\n~~(1) Avoids nonparticipating customers, such as existing residential, small\nbusiness, and agricultural ratepayers, bearing cost shifts, such as the costs\nof interconnecting facilities or loads that fall short of initial\nprojections.~~\n\n~~(2) Assists each electrical corporation with fulfilling its obligation to\nserve its customers at just and reasonable rates.~~\n\n~~(3) Does not increase fossil fuel consumption within the state.~~\n\n_(1) Ensures just and reasonable rates for customers of electrical\ncorporations and does not result in cost shifts to customers who do not\nreceive the special electrical corporation tariff._\n\n~~(4)~~\n\n_(2)_ Meets the state's climate change goals by reducing the emissions of\ngreenhouse gases associated with electrical generation.\n\n~~(5)~~\n\n_(3)_ Promotes stable or reduced retail rates for electrical service.\n\n~~(6)~~\n\n_(4)_ Contributes to the safe and reliable operation of the electrical grid,\nincluding by providing predictable electrical supply, voltage support, lower\nline losses, and congestion relief.\n\n~~(7) Permits qualified data centers to use a reasonable percentage of behind-\nthe-meter electricity that is generated as zero carbon, and requires backup\ngeneration that includes energy storage.~~\n\n~~(8) Requires onsite battery storage that provides demand response services\nto the electrical grid.~~\n\n~~(9)~~\n\n_(5)_ Ensures electrical grid investments to serve~~a data center~~ _an\neligible customer_ are fully recovered from the~~data center~~ _eligible\ncustomer_ in the event that the~~data center~~ _eligible customer_ ceases\noperations or uses less electricity than initially projected.\n\n~~(10)~~\n\n_(6)_ For~~data centers~~ _eligible customers_ taking transmission-level\ndelivery service, collects a reasonable share of the costs relating to\nwildfire mitigation, wildfire liability, electrification and environmental\nprograms, and other societal cost obligations typically included in\ndistribution rates.\n\n~~(b) On or before January 1, 2030, the commission shall require all retail\nsellers subject to its jurisdiction to serve any data center subject to the\ntariff or program established or modified pursuant to this section with\nelectricity from 100 percent zero-carbon resources in a manner that does not\nresult in resource shuffling and does not increase carbon emissions elsewhere\nin the western grid.~~\n\n_(b) The commission may require an eligible customer to site distributed\nenergy storage systems and backup power systems that better enable the state\nto meet its emission reduction goals, as determined by the commission._\n\n_(c) The commission may establish minimum requirements for zero-carbon\nprocurement on behalf of a retail seller for an eligible customer receiving\nthe special electrical corporation tariff._\n\n~~(c)~~\n\n_(d)_ For purposes of this section, both of the following definitions apply:\n\n~~(1) \"Data center\" means a large-scale energy consumer connecting at a\ntransmission level voltage of at least 50 kilovolts that requires\nuninterruptible electricity housing servers and related data center equipment\nand software whose primary services are the storage, management, processing,\nand distribution of data.~~\n\n_(1) \"Eligible customer\" means a customer connecting transmission-level\nservice of at least 50 kilovolts and with an estimated demand of at least 50\nmegawatts._\n\n(2) \"Retail seller\" has the same meaning as defined in Section 399.12.\n\nSEC. 4. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of\nArticle XIIIB of the California Constitution because the only costs that may\nbe incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this\nact creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or\nchanges the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section\n17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the\nmeaning of Section 6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
