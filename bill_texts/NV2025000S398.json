If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law requires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior authorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond to a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the request. (NRS 687B.225) This bill establishes additional requirements relating to the use of prior authorization for medical and dental care by health insurers, including Medicaid, the Children&rsquo;s Health Insurance Program and insurance for public employees.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Specifically, <b>sections 25 and 56</b> of this bill require that a procedure for obtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and services for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the clinical review criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior authorization. <b>Sections 25 and 56</b> also require an insurer to publish its procedure for obtaining prior authorization on its Internet website and update that website as necessary to account for any changes in the procedure. <b>Sections 25 and 56</b> prohibit an insurer from denying a claim for payment for medical or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior authorization if the insurer&rsquo;s procedures for obtaining prior authorization in effect on the date on which the care was provided did not require prior authorization for that care.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Sections 25 and 57</b> of this bill require a determination concerning a request for prior authorization to include a determination of whether the purported insured is currently insured by the insurer and eligible for coverage. <b>Sections 25 and 57</b> also revise the period for insurers to take action on a request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve or make an adverse determination on such a request, or request additional, medically relevant information within: (1) 48 hours after receiving the request, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24 hours after receiving the request, for care that is urgent. <b>Sections 13 and 58</b> of this bill require any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to be made by a licensed physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a dentist, who has certain qualifications. <b>Sections 13 and 58</b> require an insurer, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who requested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the request with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a determination on the request. <b>Sections 13 and 58</b> require an insurer, upon making an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to transmit certain information to the insured to whom the request pertains, including information relating to the right of the insured to appeal the adverse determination. <b>Sections 13 and 58</b> further require: (1) an insurer to establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of appeals submitted by insureds;

(2) prohibit an insurer from requiring an insured with a chronic or long-term condition who has received prior authorization for care for the condition to seek additional prior authorization for that same care in certain circumstances; and (3) require an insurer, for the first 90 days after the coverage period begins for a new insured, to honor a request for prior authorization that has been approved by the previous insurer of the new insured, under certain circumstances. <b>Sections 15 and 60</b> of this bill establish certain limited circumstances under which an insurer may revoke, limit, condition or restrict an approval of a request for prior authorization previously granted by the insurer. <b>Sections 16 and 61</b> of this bill prohibit an insurer from refusing to pay a claim or reducing the amount paid to a provider of health care for a claim for medical or dental care that was previously approved by the insurer, with certain exceptions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Sections 17 and 63</b> of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization for covered emergency services. <b>Sections 17 and 63</b> prohibit an insurer from requiring that an insured or provider of health care notify the insurer earlier than the end of the business day following the date of admission or the date on which the emergency services are provided. <b>Sections 17 and 63</b>: (1) prohibit an insurer from denying coverage for covered medically necessary emergency services; and (2) establish a presumption of medical necessity under certain conditions. <b>Sections 17 and 63</b> also require an insurer to respond to a request for prior authorization for certain follow-up care relating to the emergency care received by an insured within 60 minutes after receiving the request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>Sections 18 and 62</b> of this bill prohibit an insurer from requiring prior authorization for: (1) certain invasive procedures that are incidental to or different from a procedure for which the insurer has already granted prior authorization or does not require prior authorization;

(BDR 57-731)\n\nFISCAL NOTE: Effect on Local Government: May have Fiscal Impact.\n\nEffect on the State: Yes.\n\nAN ACT relating to insurance; revising provisions relating to prior\nauthorization for certain medical and dental care; revising provisions\nrelating to the coverage of autism spectrum disorders for certain persons;\nprohibiting health insurers from considering the availability of certain\npublic benefits for certain purposes; and providing other matters properly\nrelating thereto.\n\n**Legislative Counsel 's Digest:**\n\nExisting law authorizes certain health insurers to require prior authorization\nbefore an insured may receive coverage for medical and dental care in certain\ncircumstances. If an insurer requires prior authorization, existing law\nrequires the insurer to: (1) file its procedure for obtaining prior\nauthorization with the Commissioner of Insurance for approval; and (2) respond\nto a request for prior authorization within 20 days after receiving the\nrequest. (NRS 687B.225) This bill establishes additional requirements relating\nto the use of prior authorization for medical and dental care by health\ninsurers, including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and\ninsurance for public employees.\n\nSpecifically, **sections 25 and 56** of this bill require that a procedure for\nobtaining prior authorization includes: (1) a list of the specific goods and\nservices for which the insurer requires prior authorization; and (2) the\nclinical review criteria used by the insurer to evaluate requests for prior\nauthorization. **Sections 25 and 56** also require an insurer to publish its\nprocedure for obtaining prior authorization on its Internet website and update\nthat website as necessary to account for any changes in the procedure.\n**Sections 25 and 56** prohibit an insurer from denying a claim for payment\nfor medical or dental care because of the failure to obtain prior\nauthorization if the insurer's procedures for obtaining prior authorization in\neffect on the date on which the care was provided did not require prior\nauthorization for that care.\n\n**Sections 25 and 57** of this bill require a determination concerning a\nrequest for prior authorization to include a determination of whether the\npurported insured is currently insured by the insurer and eligible for\ncoverage. **Sections 25 and 57** also revise the period for insurers to take\naction on a request for prior authorization by requiring an insurer to approve\nor make an adverse determination on such a request, or request additional,\nmedically relevant information within: (1) 48 hours after receiving the\nrequest, for medical or dental care that is not urgent; or (2) 24 hours after\nreceiving the request, for care that is urgent. **Sections 13 and 58** of this\nbill require any adverse determination on a request for prior authorization to\nbe made by a licensed physician or, for a request relating to dental care, a\ndentist, who has certain qualifications. **Sections 13 and 58** require an\ninsurer, in certain circumstances, to allow the provider of health care who\nrequested the prior authorization to discuss the issues involved in the\nrequest with the physician or dentist who is responsible for making a\ndetermination on the request. **Sections 13 and 58** require an insurer, upon\nmaking an adverse determination on a request for prior authorization, to\ntransmit certain information to the insured to whom the request pertains,\nincluding information relating to the right of the insured to appeal the\nadverse determination. **Sections 13 and 58** further require: (1) an insurer\nto establish a process for appeals that provides for the timely resolution of\nappeals submitted by insureds;
