State tax.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">1506. Disposition of taxes.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Section 1500. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature hereby finds and declares that: 1. Under the New York penal law a person engages in gambling when such person stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under such person&#39;s control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that such person will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">2. A contest of chance is defined as any contest, game, gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein. (Subdivision 1 of section 225.00 of the penal law). Thus, games of chance may involve some skill, but in those games the level of skill does not determine the outcome regardless of the degree of skill employed. See People v. Turner, 165 Misc. 2d 222, 224, 629 N.Y.S.2d 661, 662 (Crim. Ct. 1995). On the other hand, where a contest pits the skill levels of the players against each other, New York courts have found a game to be one of skill rather than chance. See People v. Hunt, 162 Misc. 2d 70, 72, 616 N.Y.S.2d 168, 170 (Crim. Ct. 1994) (&quot;Played fairly, skill rather than chance is the material component of three-card monte.&quot;);</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3. Poker in many instances has been defined as a game of skill and a New York federal court in U.S. v. DiCristina, 886 F. Supp. 2d 164, 224, assessed that under federal law poker was predominantly a game of skill;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">4. New York courts have interpreted New York law to apply a more rigorous test in identifying a &quot;contest of chance&quot; than is applied by most states in this nation and the courts have found that where a contest pits the skill levels of the players against each other, those games are games of skill and not games of chance. Furthermore, the courts have not limited the legislature&#39;s ability to determine that certain forms of poker should fall outside the general definition of gambling since those games are games of skill;</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">5. Texas Hold&#39;em poker involves two cards dealt face down to each player and then five community cards placed face-up by the dealer, a series of three, then two additional single cards, with players determining whether to check, bet, raise or fold after each deal. Omaha Hold&#39;em poker is a similar game, in which each player is dealt four cards and makes such player&#39;s best hand using exactly two of them, plus exactly three of the five community cards. These games are considered to be complex forms of poker which involve player strategy and decisionmaking and which pit the skill levels of the players against each other. As games of skill, these forms of poker do not fall under the definition of gambling as prohibited by the penal law; and</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">6. The legislature further finds that as the internet has become an integral part of society, and internet poker a major form of entertainment for many consumers, any interactive gaming enforcement and regulatory structure must begin from the bedrock premise that participation in a lawful and licensed gaming industry is a privilege and not a right, and that regulatory oversight is intended to safeguard the integrity of the games and participants and to ensure accountability and the public trust.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">Section 1501. Definitions.

The intermediate routing of electronic data in connection with interactive gaming shall not determine the location or locations in which a wager is initiated, received or otherwise made.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">3. &quot;Core function&quot; means any of the following: (a) the management, administration or control of wagers on interactive gaming; (b) the management, administration or control of the games with which those wagers are associated; or (c) the development, maintenance, provision or operation of an interactive gaming platform.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">4. &quot;Commission&quot; means the New York state gaming commission.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">5. &quot;Division&quot; means the division of gaming, established under paragraph (c) of subdivision two of section one hundred three of this chapter.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">6. &quot;Interactive gaming&quot; means the conduct of games through the use of the internet or other communications technology that allows a person, utilizing money, checks, electronic checks, electronic transfers of money, credit cards, debit cards or any other instrumentality, to transmit to a computer information to assist in the placing of a wager and corresponding information related to the display of the game, game outcomes or other similar information.

A licensee may utilize multiple interactive gaming platforms provided that each platform is approved by the commission.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">11. &quot;Omaha Hold&#39;em poker&quot; means the poker game marketed as Omaha Hold&#39;em poker or Omaha poker in which each player is dealt four cards and must make such player&#39;s best hand using exactly two of them, plus exactly three of the five community cards.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">12. &quot;Significant vendor&quot; means any person who offers or who proposes to offer any of the following services with respect to interactive gaming: (a) a core function; (b) sale, licensing or other receipt of compensation for selling or licensing a database or customer list of individuals residing in the United States selected in whole or in part because they placed wagers or participated in gambling games with or through an internet website or operator (or any derivative of such a database or customer list); (c) provision of any trademark, tradename, service mark or similar intellectual property under which a licensee or significant vendor identifies interactive games to customers; or (d) provision of any product, service or asset to a licensee or significant vendor in return for a percentage of interactive gaming revenue (not including fees to financial institutions and payment providers for facilitating a deposit or withdrawal by an authorized participant).

Institutional investors are subject to the provisions set out in this section.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(a) An institutional investor holding under twenty-five percent of the equity securities of a licensee&#39;s or significant vendor&#39;s (or applicant&#39;s) holding or intermediary companies, shall be granted a waiver of any investigation of suitability or other requirement if such securities are those of a corporation, whether publicly traded or privately held, and its holdings of such securities were purchased for investment purposes only and it files a certified statement to the effect that it has no intention of influencing or affecting the affairs of the issuer, the licensee (or significant vendor or applicant, as applicable) or its holding or intermediary companies; provided, however, that it shall be permitted to vote on matters put to the vote of the outstanding security holders.

The licensee (or significant vendor or applicant, as applicable) and its relevant holding, intermediary or subsidiary company shall notify the commission immediately of any information about, or actions of, an institutional investor holding its equity securities where such information or action may impact upon the eligibility of such institutional investor for a waiver pursuant to this paragraph.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(b) If at any time the commission finds that an institutional investor holding any security of a holding or intermediary company of a licensee or significant vendor or applicant, or, where relevant, of another subsidiary company of a holding or intermediary company of a licensee or significant vendor or applicant which is related in any way to the financing of the licensee or significant vendor or applicant, fails to comply with the terms of paragraph (a) of this section, or if at any time the commission finds that, by reason of the extent or nature of its holdings, an institutional investor is in a position to exercise such a substantial impact upon the controlling interests of a licensee or significant vendor or applicant that investigation and determination of suitability of the institutional investor is necessary to protect the public interest, the commission may take any necessary action otherwise authorized under this article to protect the public interest.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(c) For purposes of this section, an &quot;institutional investor&quot; shall mean any retirement fund administered by a public agency for the exclusive benefit of federal, state, or local public employees; investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C.

Subdivision 1 of section 225.00 of the penal law is amended to read as follows: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. &quot;Contest of chance&quot; means any contest, game, gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">in a material degree</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">predominantly</u> upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.

WOERNER -- read once and referred to the Committee on\nRacing and Wagering\n\nAN ACT to amend the racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law and the\npenal law, in relation to allowing certain interactive poker games\n\n**The People of the State of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do\nenact as follows:**\n\nSection 1. The racing, pari-mutuel wagering and breeding law is amended by\nadding a new article 15 to read as follows:\n\n_ARTICLE 15_\n\n_INTERACTIVE GAMING_\n\n_Section 1500. Legislative findings and purpose._\n\n_1501\\. Definitions._\n\n_1502\\. Authorization._\n\n_1503\\. Required safeguards/minimum standards._\n\n_1504\\. Scope of licensing review._\n\n_1505\\. State tax._\n\n_1506\\. Disposition of taxes._\n\n_Section 1500. Legislative findings and purpose. The legislature hereby finds\nand declares that: 1. Under the New York penal law a person engages in\ngambling when such person stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome\nof a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under such person 's\ncontrol or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that such person will\nreceive something of value in the event of a certain outcome._\n\n_2\\. A contest of chance is defined as any contest, game, gaming scheme or\ngaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an\nelement of chance, notwithstanding that skill of the contestants may also be a\nfactor therein. (Subdivision 1 of section 225.00 of the penal law). Thus,\ngames of chance may involve some skill, but in those games the level of skill\ndoes not determine the outcome regardless of the degree of skill employed. See\nPeople v. Turner, 165 Misc. 2d 222, 224, 629 N.Y.S.2d 661, 662 (Crim. Ct.\n1995). On the other hand, where a contest pits the skill levels of the players\nagainst each other, New York courts have found a game to be one of skill\nrather than chance. See People v. Hunt, 162 Misc. 2d 70, 72, 616 N.Y.S.2d 168,\n170 (Crim. Ct. 1994) ( \"Played fairly, skill rather than chance is the\nmaterial component of three-card monte.\");_\n\n_3\\. Poker in many instances has been defined as a game of skill and a New\nYork federal court in U.S. v. DiCristina, 886 F. Supp. 2d 164, 224, assessed\nthat under federal law poker was predominantly a game of skill;_\n\n_4\\. New York courts have interpreted New York law to apply a more rigorous\ntest in identifying a \"contest of chance\" than is applied by most states in\nthis nation and the courts have found that where a contest pits the skill\nlevels of the players against each other, those games are games of skill and\nnot games of chance. Furthermore, the courts have not limited the\nlegislature's ability to determine that certain forms of poker should fall\noutside the general definition of gambling since those games are games of\nskill;_\n\n_5\\. Texas Hold 'em poker involves two cards dealt face down to each player\nand then five community cards placed face-up by the dealer, a series of three,\nthen two additional single cards, with players determining whether to check,\nbet, raise or fold after each deal. Omaha Hold'em poker is a similar game, in\nwhich each player is dealt four cards and makes such player's best hand using\nexactly two of them, plus exactly three of the five community cards. These\ngames are considered to be complex forms of poker which involve player\nstrategy and decisionmaking and which pit the skill levels of the players\nagainst each other. As games of skill, these forms of poker do not fall under\nthe definition of gambling as prohibited by the penal law; and_\n\n_6\\. The legislature further finds that as the internet has become an integral\npart of society, and internet poker a major form of entertainment for many\nconsumers, any interactive gaming enforcement and regulatory structure must\nbegin from the bedrock premise that participation in a lawful and licensed\ngaming industry is a privilege and not a right, and that regulatory oversight\nis intended to safeguard the integrity of the games and participants and to\nensure accountability and the public trust._\n\n_Section 1501. Definitions. As used in this article, the following terms shall\nhave the following meanings:_\n\n_1. \"Authorized game\" means Omaha Hold'em and Texas Hold'em poker, as well as\nany other poker game that the commission determines is the material equivalent\nof either of those, whether in a cash game or tournament._\n\n_2. \"Authorized participants\" means persons who are either physically present\nin this state when placing a wager or who otherwise are permitted by\napplicable law, as determined by the commission, to place a wager.
