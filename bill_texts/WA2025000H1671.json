If a controller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes the request is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made the request, stating that the controller believes the request to be fraudulent, why the controller believes the request to be fraudulent, and that the controller will not comply with the request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a source other than the consumer is deemed in compliance with a consumer&#39;s request to delete such data pursuant to section 3(1)(d) of this act by deleting the consumer&#39;s personal data retained by the controller and retaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring the consumer&#39;s personal data remains deleted from the controller&#39;s records and not using such retained data for any other purpose pursuant to this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller&#39;s refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer&#39;s receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting consumer rights requests. Within 45 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) A controller may not condition, effectively condition, attempt to condition, or attempt to effectively condition the exercise of a consumer right described in section 3 of this act through the use of dark patterns or any false, fictitious, fraudulent, or materially misleading statement or representation.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(8) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing account.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(9) A controller shall establish, and describe in the controller&#39;s privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter. Such means must take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer making the request. Such means must include:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller&#39;s internet website to an internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising, the sale of the consumer&#39;s personal data, and profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Not later than December 31, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt out of any collection or processing of the consumer&#39;s personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of the consumer&#39;s personal data, through an opt-out preference signal that is sent, with the consumer&#39;s consent, by a platform, technology, or mechanism to the controller and that indicates the consumer&#39;s intent to opt out of any processing or sale.

The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The processor shall adhere to the instructions of the controller and only process and transfer data it receives from the controller to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by the controller, as set out in the contract. The contract must also require that the processor:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to that data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) At the controller&#39;s direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor&#39;s compliance with this chapter;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction of the processor with an individual; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller&#39;s designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor&#39;s policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments.

A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data pursuant to a controller&#39;s instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to that specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller&#39;s instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 8. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS. (1) A controller may not conduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer without conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of the controller&#39;s processing activities that presents the heightened risk of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The sale of personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful disparate impact on consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude, seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) Other substantial injury to consumers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The collection or processing of sensitive data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes for collecting personal data, and whether personal data is being transferred. Data protection assessments must also identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is being processed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3)(a) A controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or evaluation to the attorney general upon request. The report must include a summary of the data protection assessment, and the controller shall make the summary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general upon request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment before initiating a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. Throughout the processing activity&#39;s life cycle, the controller shall review and update the data protection assessment as often as appropriate, taking into consideration the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data collected or processed and the level of risk presented by the processing, in order to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards accordingly; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller makes new decisions with respect to the processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) The first data protection assessment required by this section must be completed no later than one year after the effective date of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 9.

The contract must be binding and must clearly set\nforth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing,\nthe type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the\nrights and obligations of both parties. The processor shall adhere to the\ninstructions of the controller and only process and transfer data it receives\nfrom the controller to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by\nthe controller, as set out in the contract. The contract must also require\nthat the processor:\n\n(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of\nconfidentiality with respect to that data;\n\n(b) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the\ncontroller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless\nretention of the personal data is required by law;\n\n(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the\ncontroller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the\nprocessor's compliance with this chapter;\n\n(d) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any\nsubcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor\nto meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;\n\n(e) Be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives\nfrom or on behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor\nreceives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction\nof the processor with an individual; and\n\n(f) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the\ncontroller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent\nassessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical\nand organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter,\nusing an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment\nprocedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such\nassessment to the controller upon request.\n\n(3) A processor shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative,\ntechnical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy\nreasonable standard of care within the processor's industry to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to\nthe volume and nature of the personal data at issue.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or\nprocessor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by\nvirtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship,\nas described in this chapter.\n\n(5) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with\nrespect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-based\ndetermination that depends on the context in which personal data is to be\nprocessed. A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data\npursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such\ninstructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to that\nspecific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to\na controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal\ndata remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others,\ndetermining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the\nprocessor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject\nto an enforcement action under this chapter.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 8. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS. (1) A controller may not\nconduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer\nwithout conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of\nthe controller's processing activities that presents the heightened risk of\nharm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents\na heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:\n\n(a) The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted\nadvertising;\n\n(b) The sale of personal data;\n\n(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such\nprofiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:\n\n(i) Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful disparate impact on\nconsumers;\n\n(ii) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;\n\n(iii) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude, seclusion, or the\nprivate affairs or concerns of consumers, where such intrusion would be\noffensive to a reasonable person; or\n\n(iv) Other substantial injury to consumers; and\n\n(d) The collection or processing of sensitive data.\n\n(2) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this\nsection must identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes\nfor collecting personal data, and whether personal data is being transferred.\nData protection assessments must also identify and weigh the benefits that may\nflow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the\nconsumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to\nthe rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by\nsafeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The\ncontroller shall factor into any data protection assessment the use of\ndeidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the\ncontext of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the\nconsumer whose personal data is being processed.\n\n(3)(a) A controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or\nevaluation to the attorney general upon request. The report must include a\nsummary of the data protection assessment, and the controller shall make the\nsummary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.\n\n(b) The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data\nprotection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the\nattorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment\navailable to the attorney general upon request. The attorney general may\nevaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the\nresponsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information\ncontained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general\nincludes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product\nprotection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or\nprotection.\n\n(4) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of\nprocessing operations that include similar activities.\n\n(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of\ncomplying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection\nassessment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section if the data\nprotection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data\nprotection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this\nsection.\n\n(6) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment\nbefore initiating a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of\nharm to a consumer. Throughout the processing activity's life cycle, the\ncontroller shall review and update the data protection assessment as often as\nappropriate, taking into consideration the type, amount, and sensitivity of\npersonal data collected or processed and the level of risk presented by the\nprocessing, in order to:\n\n(a) Monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards\naccordingly; and\n\n(b) Ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller\nmakes new decisions with respect to the processing.\n\n(7) The first data protection assessment required by this section must be\ncompleted no later than one year after the effective date of this section.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 9. DEIDENTIFIED DATA. (1) Any controller in possession of\ndeidentified data shall:\n\n(a) Take technical measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with\nan individual;\n\n(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using deidentified data without\nattempting to reidentify the data; and\n\n(c) Contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply\nwith all provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or\nprocessor to:\n\n(a) Reidentify deidentified data;\n\n(b) Maintain data in an identifiable form; or\n\n(c) Collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology in order to be\ncapable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.\n\n(3) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or\nprocessor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the\ncontroller:\n\n(a) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal\ndata or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate\nthe request with the personal data; and\n\n(b) Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific\nconsumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal\ndata with other personal data about the same specific consumer.\n\n(4) A controller that transfers deidentified data shall exercise reasonable\noversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the\ndeidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any\nbreaches of those contractual commitments.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 10. LIMITATIONS.

A third-party controller or processor\nreceiving personal data in compliance with this chapter from a controller or\nprocessor is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the transgressions\nof the controller or processor from which it receives the personal data.\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to:\n\n(a) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects\nthe rights or freedoms of any persons including, but not limited to, the\nrights of any person to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed\nin the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under the\nWashington reporter shield law, chapter _5.68_ RCW;\n\n(b) Apply to any person's collection or processing of personal data in the\ncourse of the person's purely personal or household activities; or\n\n(c) For private schools approved by the state under chapter _28A.195_ RCW and\nprivate institutions of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C.

A controller should provide a reasonable opportunity for each consumer to affirmatively consent to further materially different processing or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed policy. The controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to provide direct notification regarding material changes to the privacy notice to each affected consumer, taking into account available technology and the nature of the relationship.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(10) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such selling or processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such selling or processing. The sale of consumer health data must comply with RCW <u>19.373.030</u>.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 7. RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROCESSORS.(1) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting the controller&#39;s obligations under this chapter. A processor&#39;s assistance must include:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is reasonably practicable, assisting the controller in fulfilling the controller&#39;s obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, assisting the controller in meeting the controller&#39;s obligation in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notification of a breach of the security of the processor&#39;s system in order to meet the controller&#39;s obligations; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) The processor&#39;s data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller must be governed by a contract between a controller and a processor. The contract must be binding and must clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties. The processor shall adhere to the instructions of the controller and only process and transfer data it receives from the controller to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by the controller, as set out in the contract. The contract must also require that the processor:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to that data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) At the controller&#39;s direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor&#39;s compliance with this chapter;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor receives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction of the processor with an individual; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller&#39;s designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor&#39;s policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter, using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such assessment to the controller upon request.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) A processor shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative, technical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy reasonable standard of care within the processor&#39;s industry to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s role in the processing relationship, as described in this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-based determination that depends on the context in which personal data is to be processed. A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data pursuant to a controller&#39;s instructions, or who fails to adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to that specific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to a controller&#39;s instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject to an enforcement action under this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 8. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS. (1) A controller may not conduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer without conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of the controller&#39;s processing activities that presents the heightened risk of harm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The sale of personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful disparate impact on consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude, seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns of consumers, where such intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iv) Other substantial injury to consumers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) The collection or processing of sensitive data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this section must identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes for collecting personal data, and whether personal data is being transferred. Data protection assessments must also identify and weigh the benefits that may flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any data protection assessment the use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is being processed.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3)(a) A controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or evaluation to the attorney general upon request. The report must include a summary of the data protection assessment, and the controller shall make the summary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the attorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the attorney general upon request. The attorney general may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general includes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product protection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection assessment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section if the data protection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(6) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment before initiating a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer. Throughout the processing activity&#39;s life cycle, the controller shall review and update the data protection assessment as often as appropriate, taking into consideration the type, amount, and sensitivity of personal data collected or processed and the level of risk presented by the processing, in order to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards accordingly; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller makes new decisions with respect to the processing.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(7) The first data protection assessment required by this section must be completed no later than one year after the effective date of this section.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 9. DEIDENTIFIED DATA. (1) Any controller in possession of deidentified data shall:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Take technical measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with an individual;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using deidentified data without attempting to reidentify the data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply with all provisions of this chapter.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Reidentify deidentified data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Maintain data in an identifiable form; or</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the controller:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) A controller that transfers deidentified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the deidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u>NEW SECTION.</u> Sec. 10. LIMITATIONS. (1) The obligations imposed on controllers and processors under this chapter do not restrict a controller&#39;s or processor&#39;s ability to:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations, except as prohibited by the Washington shield law, chapter <u>7.115</u> RCW;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental authorities;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Provide a product or service specifically requested by the consumer;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written warranty;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or another individual, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal activity targeted at or involving the controller or processor or its services; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for any such action;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(j) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all relevant laws and regulations governing such research, if applicable, and is approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional review board, human subjects research ethics review board, or a similar independent oversight entity that determines whether:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) The deletion of personal data requested by a consumer pursuant to section 3 of this act is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to the controller;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(iii) The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including any risks associated with reidentification;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(k) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the obligations under this chapter;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(l) Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, community health, or population health, but solely to the extent that such processing is:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being processed; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(ii) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality obligations under federal, state, or local law;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(m) Ensure the data security and integrity of personal data as required by this chapter, protect against spam, or protect and maintain networks and systems, including through diagnostics, debugging, and repairs;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(n) Transfer assets to a third party in the context of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar transaction when the third party assumes control, in whole or in part, of the controller&#39;s assets, provided that the controller, in a reasonable time prior to the transfer, provides an affected consumer with notice describing the transfer, including the name of the entity receiving the consumer&#39;s personal data and the applicable privacy policies of such entity, and a reasonable opportunity to withdraw previously provided consent related to the consumer&#39;s personal data and to request the deletion of the consumer&#39;s personal data;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(o) Effectuate a product recall pursuant to federal or state law, or to fulfill a warranty;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(p) Conduct medical research in compliance with 45 C.F.R.

If a\ncontroller denies an opt-out request because the controller believes the\nrequest is fraudulent, the controller shall send notice to the person who made\nthe request, stating that the controller believes the request to be\nfraudulent, why the controller believes the request to be fraudulent, and that\nthe controller will not comply with the request.\n\n(5) A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a\nsource other than the consumer is deemed in compliance with a consumer's\nrequest to delete such data pursuant to section 3(1)(d) of this act by\ndeleting the consumer's personal data retained by the controller and retaining\na record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for the\npurpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the\ncontroller's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose\npursuant to this chapter.\n\n(6) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the\ncontroller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of\ntime after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process must be\nconspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting consumer\nrights requests. Within 45 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall\ninform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to\nthe appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.\nIf the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with\nan online mechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer\nmay contact the attorney general to submit a complaint.\n\n(7) A controller may not condition, effectively condition, attempt to\ncondition, or attempt to effectively condition the exercise of a consumer\nright described in section 3 of this act through the use of dark patterns or\nany false, fictitious, fraudulent, or materially misleading statement or\nrepresentation.\n\n(8) A controller may not require a consumer to create a new account in order\nto exercise consumer rights, but may require a consumer to use an existing\naccount.\n\n(9) A controller shall establish, and describe in the controller's privacy\nnotice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a\nrequest to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to this chapter. Such means\nmust take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the\ncontroller, the need for secure and reliable communication of such requests,\nand the ability of the controller to verify the identity of the consumer\nmaking the request. Such means must include:\n\n(a) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's internet\nwebsite to an internet web page that enables a consumer, or an agent of the\nconsumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising, the sale of the consumer's\npersonal data, and profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that\nproduce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer; and\n\n(b) Not later than December 31, 2025, allowing a consumer to opt out of any\ncollection or processing of the consumer's personal data for the purposes of\ntargeted advertising, or any sale of the consumer's personal data, through an\nopt-out preference signal that is sent, with the consumer's consent, by a\nplatform, technology, or mechanism to the controller and that indicates the\nconsumer's intent to opt out of any processing or sale. The platform,\ntechnology, or mechanism must:\n\n(i) Be consumer friendly and easy to use by the average consumer; and\n\n(ii) Enable the controller to reasonably determine that the consumer is a\nWashington resident and whether the consumer has made a legitimate request to\nopt out of any sale of such consumer's personal data or targeted advertising.\nFor purposes of this subsection, the use of an internet protocol address to\nestimate the consumer's location shall be considered sufficient to reasonably\ndetermine residency.\n\n(10) If a consumer's decision to opt out of any processing of the consumer's\npersonal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any sale of the\nconsumer's personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in\naccordance with subsection (9) of this section conflicts with the consumer's\nexisting controller specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a\ncontroller's financial incentive program, the controller shall comply with the\nconsumer's opt-out preference signal, but may notify the consumer of the\nconflict and provide to the consumer the choice to confirm the controller\nspecific privacy setting or participation in the program.\n\n(11) If a controller responds to the consumer opt-out requests received\npursuant to subsection (9) of this section by informing the consumer of a\nchange in the price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services,\nthe controller shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered\npursuant to section 6(7) of this act for the retention, use, sale, or sharing\nof the consumer's personal data.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 6.

(1)(a) Except as\nspecified in (b) of this subsection, a controller shall limit the collection,\nprocessing, and transfer of personal data to what is strictly necessary in\nrelation to provide or maintain:\n\n(i) A specific product or service requested by the consumer to whom the data\npertains, including any routine administrative, operational, or account-\nservicing activity, such as billing, shipping, delivery, storage, or\naccounting; or\n\n(ii) A communication, that is not an advertisement, by the controller to the\nconsumer reasonably anticipated within the context of the relationship between\nthe controller and the consumer.\n\n(b) A controller may only collect and transfer consumer health data in\naccordance with RCW _19.373.030_.\n\n(c) Except with respect to sensitive data, a controller may process or\ntransfer personal data collected under this subsection to provide first-party\nadvertising or targeted advertising. However, this subsection does not permit\nthe processing or transfer of personal data for targeted advertising to a\nconsumer who has opted out of such advertising pursuant to this chapter or to\na consumer under circumstances where the controller has knowledge, or\nwillfully disregards, that the consumer is a minor.\n\n(2) Except as specified in RCW _19.373.030_ , a controller may not transfer\nsensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the consumer's\naffirmative consent, or, in the case of the collection or processing of\nsensitive data of a known child, without collecting or processing such data in\naccordance with the children's online privacy protection act, 15 U.S.C. Sec.\n6501 through 6506 and its implementing regulations.\n\n(3) A controller may not sell sensitive data, with the exception of consumer\nhealth data, which may be sold in accordance with RCW _19.373.070_.\n\n(4) A controller shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative,\ntechnical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy\nreasonable standard of care within the controller's industry to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to\nthe volume and nature of the personal data at issue, including disposing of\npersonal data in accordance with a retention schedule that requires the\ndeletion of personal data when the data is required to be deleted by law or is\nno longer necessary for the purpose for which the data was collected,\nprocessed, or transferred.\n\n(5) A controller shall provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke\nthe consumer's affirmative consent that is at least as easy as the mechanism\nby which the consumer provided the consumer's affirmative consent. Upon\nrevocation of the consumer's affirmative consent, the controller shall cease\nto process the data as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 days after\nthe receipt of the revocation.\n\n(6) A controller may not process the personal data of a consumer for purposes\nof targeted advertising or sell the consumer's personal data under the\ncircumstances where a controller has actual knowledge, or willfully\ndisregards, that the consumer is a minor.\n\n(7)(a) A controller may not discriminate or retaliate against a consumer for\nexercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, or for\nrefusing to agree to the collection or processing of personal data for a\nseparate product or service, including by denying goods or services, charging\ndifferent prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different\nlevel of quality of goods or services to the consumer.\n\n(b) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to require a controller to\nprovide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer\nwhich the controller does not collect or maintain.\n\n(c)(i) Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit a controller\nfrom offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods\nor services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if\nthe offering is in connection with a consumer's voluntary participation in a\nfinancial incentive program, such as a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium\nfeatures, discounts, or club card program, provided that the controller may\nnot transfer personal data to a third party as part of such a program unless:\n\n(A) The transfer is functionally necessary to enable the third party to\nprovide a benefit to which the consumer is entitled;\n\n(B) The transfer of personal data to the third party is clearly disclosed in\nthe terms of the program; and\n\n(C) The third party uses the personal data only for purposes of facilitating a\nbenefit to which the consumer is entitled and does not process or transfer the\npersonal data for any other purpose.\n\n(ii) The sale of personal data must not be considered functionally necessary\nto provide a financial incentive program. A controller may not use financial\nincentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable, coercive, or usurious in\nnature.\n\n(8)(a) A controller or processor may not collect, process, or transfer\npersonal data in a manner that discriminates against an individual or class of\nindividuals, or otherwise makes unavailable the equal enjoyment of goods or\nservices, on the basis of an individual's or class of individuals' actual or\nperceived race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,\nreligion, ancestry, or national origin.\n\n(b) This subsection does not apply to:\n\n(i) The collection, processing, or transfer of personal data for the sole\npurpose of a controller's or processor's self-testing to prevent or mitigate\nunlawful discrimination or otherwise to ensure compliance with state or\nfederal law, or for the sole purpose of diversifying an applicant,\nparticipant, or customer pool; or\n\n(ii) A private establishment, as described in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000a(e).\n\n(9)(a) A controller must provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,\nclear, and meaningful privacy notice that includes:\n\n(i) The categories of personal data collected and processed by the controller,\nincluding a separate list of categories of sensitive data collected and\nprocessed by the controller, described in a level of detail that provides\nconsumers a meaningful understanding of the type of personal data collected or\nprocessed;\n\n(ii) The categories of sources from which the consumer health data is\ncollected;\n\n(iii) The purpose for collecting and processing each category of personal data\nthe controller collects or processes, described in a way that gives consumers\na meaningful understanding of how each category of the consumers' personal\ndata will be used;\n\n(iv) How consumers may exercise their consumer rights included in section 3 of\nthis act, including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with\nregard to the consumer's request;\n\n(v) The categories of personal data that the controller transfers to third\nparties, if any, and the purposes for those transfers;\n\n(vi) The categories of third parties, if any, to which the controller\ntransfers personal data;\n\n(vii) The length of time the controller intends to retain each category of\npersonal data, or, if it is not possible to identify the length of time, the\ncriteria used to determine the length of time the controller intends to retain\ncategories of personal data; and\n\n(viii) An active email address or other online mechanism that the consumer may\nuse to contact the controller.\n\n(b) If a controller makes a material change to its privacy notice, the\ncontroller shall notify each consumer affected by the material change before\nimplementing the material change with respect to prospectively collected\npersonal data and provide a reasonable opportunity for each consumer to\nwithdraw consent. A controller should provide a reasonable opportunity for\neach consumer to affirmatively consent to further materially different\nprocessing or transfer of previously collected personal data under the changed\npolicy. The controller shall take all reasonable electronic measures to\nprovide direct notification regarding material changes to the privacy notice\nto each affected consumer, taking into account available technology and the\nnature of the relationship.\n\n(10) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes\npersonal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and\nconspicuously disclose such selling or processing, as well as the manner in\nwhich a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such selling or\nprocessing. The sale of consumer health data must comply with RCW\n_19.373.030_.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 7. RESPONSIBILITIES OF PROCESSORS.(1) A processor shall\nadhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in\nmeeting the controller's obligations under this chapter. A processor's\nassistance must include:\n\n(a) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures,\ninsofar as is reasonably practicable, assisting the controller in fulfilling\nthe controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests;\n\n(b) Taking into account the nature of processing and the information available\nto the processor, assisting the controller in meeting the controller's\nobligation in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in\nrelation to the notification of a breach of the security of the processor's\nsystem in order to meet the controller's obligations; and\n\n(c) Providing necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and\ndocument data protection assessments.\n\n(2) The processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing\nperformed on behalf of the controller must be governed by a contract between a\ncontroller and a processor. The contract must be binding and must clearly set\nforth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing,\nthe type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the\nrights and obligations of both parties. The processor shall adhere to the\ninstructions of the controller and only process and transfer data it receives\nfrom the controller to the extent necessary to provide a service requested by\nthe controller, as set out in the contract. The contract must also require\nthat the processor:\n\n(a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of\nconfidentiality with respect to that data;\n\n(b) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the\ncontroller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless\nretention of the personal data is required by law;\n\n(c) Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the\ncontroller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the\nprocessor's compliance with this chapter;\n\n(d) After providing the controller an opportunity to object, engage any\nsubcontractor pursuant to a written contract that requires the subcontractor\nto meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data;\n\n(e) Be prohibited from combining personal data that the processor receives\nfrom or on behalf of a controller with personal data that the processor\nreceives from or on behalf of another person or collects from the interaction\nof the processor with an individual; and\n\n(f) Allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by the controller or the\ncontroller's designated assessor or arrange for a qualified and independent\nassessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical\nand organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter,\nusing an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment\nprocedure for such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such\nassessment to the controller upon request.\n\n(3) A processor shall establish, implement, and maintain administrative,\ntechnical, and physical data security practices that, at a minimum, satisfy\nreasonable standard of care within the processor's industry to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data appropriate to\nthe volume and nature of the personal data at issue.\n\n(4) Nothing in this section may be construed to relieve a controller or\nprocessor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by\nvirtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship,\nas described in this chapter.\n\n(5) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with\nrespect to a specific processing of personal data is a fact-based\ndetermination that depends on the context in which personal data is to be\nprocessed. A person who is not limited in the processing of personal data\npursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to adhere to such\ninstructions, is a controller and not a processor with respect to that\nspecific processing of personal data. A processor that continues to adhere to\na controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal\ndata remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or jointly with others,\ndetermining the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, the\nprocessor is a controller with respect to such processing and may be subject\nto an enforcement action under this chapter.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 8. DATA PROTECTION ASSESSMENTS. (1) A controller may not\nconduct processing that presents a heightened risk of harm to a consumer\nwithout conducting and documenting a data protection assessment for each of\nthe controller's processing activities that presents the heightened risk of\nharm to a consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents\na heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes:\n\n(a) The collection or processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted\nadvertising;\n\n(b) The sale of personal data;\n\n(c) The processing of personal data for the purposes of profiling, where such\nprofiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:\n\n(i) Unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or unlawful disparate impact on\nconsumers;\n\n(ii) Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;\n\n(iii) A physical or other intrusion upon the solitude, seclusion, or the\nprivate affairs or concerns of consumers, where such intrusion would be\noffensive to a reasonable person; or\n\n(iv) Other substantial injury to consumers; and\n\n(d) The collection or processing of sensitive data.\n\n(2) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (1) of this\nsection must identify the categories of personal data collected, the purposes\nfor collecting personal data, and whether personal data is being transferred.\nData protection assessments must also identify and weigh the benefits that may\nflow, directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the\nconsumer, other stakeholders, and the public against the potential risks to\nthe rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as mitigated by\nsafeguards that are employed by the controller to reduce such risks. The\ncontroller shall factor into any data protection assessment the use of\ndeidentified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the\ncontext of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the\nconsumer whose personal data is being processed.\n\n(3)(a) A controller shall submit a report of the data protection assessment or\nevaluation to the attorney general upon request. The report must include a\nsummary of the data protection assessment, and the controller shall make the\nsummary publicly available in a place that is easily accessible to consumers.\n\n(b) The attorney general may require that a controller disclose any data\nprotection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the\nattorney general, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment\navailable to the attorney general upon request. The attorney general may\nevaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the\nresponsibilities set forth in this chapter. To the extent any information\ncontained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the attorney general\nincludes information subject to attorney-client privilege or work product\nprotection, the disclosure does not constitute a waiver of such privilege or\nprotection.\n\n(4) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of\nprocessing operations that include similar activities.\n\n(5) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the purpose of\ncomplying with another applicable law or regulation, the data protection\nassessment is deemed to satisfy the requirements of this section if the data\nprotection assessment is reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data\nprotection assessment that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this\nsection.\n\n(6) A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment\nbefore initiating a processing activity that presents a heightened risk of\nharm to a consumer. Throughout the processing activity's life cycle, the\ncontroller shall review and update the data protection assessment as often as\nappropriate, taking into consideration the type, amount, and sensitivity of\npersonal data collected or processed and the level of risk presented by the\nprocessing, in order to:\n\n(a) Monitor for harm caused by the processing and adjust safeguards\naccordingly; and\n\n(b) Ensure that data protection and privacy are considered as the controller\nmakes new decisions with respect to the processing.\n\n(7) The first data protection assessment required by this section must be\ncompleted no later than one year after the effective date of this section.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 9. DEIDENTIFIED DATA. (1) Any controller in possession of\ndeidentified data shall:\n\n(a) Take technical measures to ensure that the data cannot be associated with\nan individual;\n\n(b) Publicly commit to maintaining and using deidentified data without\nattempting to reidentify the data; and\n\n(c) Contractually obligate any recipients of the deidentified data to comply\nwith all provisions of this chapter.\n\n(2) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or\nprocessor to:\n\n(a) Reidentify deidentified data;\n\n(b) Maintain data in an identifiable form; or\n\n(c) Collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology in order to be\ncapable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.\n\n(3) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to require a controller or\nprocessor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request if the\ncontroller:\n\n(a) Is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal\ndata or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate\nthe request with the personal data; and\n\n(b) Does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific\nconsumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal\ndata with other personal data about the same specific consumer.\n\n(4) A controller that transfers deidentified data shall exercise reasonable\noversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the\ndeidentified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any\nbreaches of those contractual commitments.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 10. LIMITATIONS. (1) The obligations imposed on\ncontrollers and processors under this chapter do not restrict a controller's\nor processor's ability to:\n\n(a) Comply with federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations, except\nas prohibited by the Washington shield law, chapter _7.115_ RCW;\n\n(b) Comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation,\nsubpoena, or summons by federal, state, local, or other governmental\nauthorities;\n\n(c) Cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity\nthat the controller or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may\nviolate federal, state, or local laws, rules, or regulations;\n\n(d) Investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or defend legal claims;\n\n(e) Provide a product or service specifically requested by the consumer;\n\n(f) Perform under a contract to which a consumer is a party, including\nfulfilling the terms of a written warranty;\n\n(g) Take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering into a contract;\n\n(h) Take immediate steps to protect an interest that is essential for the life\nor physical safety of the consumer or another individual, and where the\nprocessing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis;\n\n(i) Prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to security incidents,\nidentity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or deceptive activities, or any\nillegal activity targeted at or involving the controller or processor or its\nservices; preserve the integrity or security of systems; or investigate,\nreport, or prosecute those responsible for any such action;\n\n(j) Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or statistical research in\nthe public interest that adheres to all relevant laws and regulations\ngoverning such research, if applicable, and is approved, monitored, and\ngoverned by an institutional review board, human subjects research ethics\nreview board, or a similar independent oversight entity that determines\nwhether:\n\n(i) The deletion of personal data requested by a consumer pursuant to section\n3 of this act is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not\nexclusively accrue to the controller;\n\n(ii) The expected benefits of the research outweigh the privacy risks; and\n\n(iii) The controller has implemented reasonable safeguards to mitigate privacy\nrisks associated with research, including any risks associated with\nreidentification;\n\n(k) Assist another controller, processor, or third party with any of the\nobligations under this chapter;\n\n(l) Process personal data for reasons of public interest in the area of public\nhealth, community health, or population health, but solely to the extent that\nsuch processing is:\n\n(i) Subject to suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of the\nconsumer whose personal data is being processed; and\n\n(ii) Under the responsibility of a professional subject to confidentiality\nobligations under federal, state, or local law;\n\n(m) Ensure the data security and integrity of personal data as required by\nthis chapter, protect against spam, or protect and maintain networks and\nsystems, including through diagnostics, debugging, and repairs;\n\n(n) Transfer assets to a third party in the context of a merger, acquisition,\nbankruptcy, or similar transaction when the third party assumes control, in\nwhole or in part, of the controller's assets, provided that the controller, in\na reasonable time prior to the transfer, provides an affected consumer with\nnotice describing the transfer, including the name of the entity receiving the\nconsumer's personal data and the applicable privacy policies of such entity,\nand a reasonable opportunity to withdraw previously provided consent related\nto the consumer's personal data and to request the deletion of the consumer's\npersonal data;\n\n(o) Effectuate a product recall pursuant to federal or state law, or to\nfulfill a warranty;\n\n(p) Conduct medical research in compliance with 45 C.F.R. Part 46 or 21 C.F.R.\nPart 50 or 56; or\n\n(q) Process personal data previously collected in accordance with this chapter\nsuch that the personal data becomes deidentified data, including to:\n\n(i) Conduct internal research to develop, improve, or repair products,\nservices, or technology;\n\n(ii) Identify and repair technical errors that impair existing or intended\nfunctionality; or\n\n(iii) Perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the\nexpectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's\nexisting relationship with the controller, or are otherwise compatible with\nprocessing data in furtherance of the provision of a product or service\nspecifically requested by a consumer or the performance of a contract to which\nthe consumer is a party.\n\n(2) The obligations imposed on controllers and processors under this chapter\ndo not apply where compliance by a controller or processor would violate an\nevidentiary privilege under Washington law and do not prevent a controller or\nprocessor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a person\ncovered by an evidentiary privilege under Washington law as part of a\nprivileged communication.\n\n(3) A controller or processor that discloses personal data in compliance with\nthis chapter to a third-party controller or processor is not in violation of\nthis chapter if the recipient processes such personal data in violation of\nthis chapter, provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, the\ndisclosing controller or processor did not have actual knowledge that the\nrecipient would violate this chapter. A third-party controller or processor\nreceiving personal data in compliance with this chapter from a controller or\nprocessor is likewise not in violation of this chapter for the transgressions\nof the controller or processor from which it receives the personal data.\n\n(4) Nothing in this chapter may be construed to:\n\n(a) Impose any obligation on a controller or processor that adversely affects\nthe rights or freedoms of any persons including, but not limited to, the\nrights of any person to freedom of speech or freedom of the press guaranteed\nin the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under the\nWashington reporter shield law, chapter _5.68_ RCW;\n\n(b) Apply to any person's collection or processing of personal data in the\ncourse of the person's purely personal or household activities; or\n\n(c) For private schools approved by the state under chapter _28A.195_ RCW and\nprivate institutions of higher education as defined in 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et\nseq., require deletion of personal data that would unreasonably interfere with\nthe provision of education services by or the ordinary operation of the school\nor institution.\n\n(5)(a) Personal data collected or processed by a controller pursuant to this\nsection may be collected or processed to the extent that the collection or\nprocessing is:\n\n(i) Strictly necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this\nsection, or, in the case of consumer health data, is in compliance with RCW\n_19.373.030_ ;\n\n(ii) Limited to what is strictly necessary in relation to the specific purpose\nor purposes listed in this section, or, in the case of consumer health data,\nin compliance with RCW _19.373.030_ ; and\n\n(iii) Compliant with section 6 of this act.\n\n(b) Personal data processed pursuant to subsection (1)(q) of this section\nmust, where applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes\nof the processing. Such data must be subject to reasonable administrative,\ntechnical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity,\nand accessibility of the personal data, and to reduce reasonably foreseeable\nrisks of harm to consumers relating to such processing of personal data.\n\n(6) If a controller collects or processes personal data pursuant to an\nexemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating\nthat such collection or processing qualifies for the exemption and complies\nwith the requirements in subsection (5) of this section.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 11.

ENFORCEMENT.The legislature finds that the practices\ncovered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for\nthe purpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter _19.86_ RCW. A\nviolation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the development and\npreservation of business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or\ncommerce and an unfair method of competition for the purpose of applying the\nconsumer protection act, chapter _19.86_ RCW.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 13. RIGHT TO CURE. (1) Before bringing an action under\nsection 12 of this act, the attorney general shall notify a controller or\nprocessor of the alleged violation if the attorney general determines that a\ncure is possible. If the controller or processor fails to cure the violation\nwithin 30 days after receiving notice of the violation, the attorney general\nmay bring a civil action without further notice.\n\n(2) This section expires August 1, 2027.\n\n_NEW SECTION._ Sec. 14.
