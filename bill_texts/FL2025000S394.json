If the applicable\nwebsite becomes unavailable or if there is no newspaper of general circulation\nin the county, the notice must be posted in at least four conspicuous places\nin the county. The supervisor or the municipal elections official _shall_\n~~may~~ , at the time of qualifying, give written notice of the time and\nlocation of the public preelection test to each candidate qualifying with that\noffice and obtain a signed receipt that the notice has been given. The\nDepartment of State shall give written notice to each statewide candidate at\nthe time of qualifying, or immediately at the end of qualifying, that the\nvoting equipment will be tested and advise each candidate to contact the\ncounty supervisor of elections as to the time and location of the public\npreelection test. The supervisor or the municipal elections official shall, at\nleast 30 days before the commencement of early voting as provided in s.\n101.657, send written notice by certified mail to the county party chair of\neach political party and to all candidates for other than statewide office\nwhose names appear on the ballot in the county and who did not receive written\nnotification from the supervisor or municipal elections official at the time\nof qualifying, stating the time and location of the public preelection test of\nthe automatic tabulating equipment _and other election systems_. The\ncanvassing board shall convene, and each member of the canvassing board shall\ncertify to the accuracy of the test. For the test, the canvassing board may\ndesignate one member to represent it. The test _must_ ~~shall~~ be open to\nrepresentatives of the political parties, the press, and the public. Each\npolitical party may designate one person with expertise in the computer field\nwho shall be allowed in the central counting room _or work area_ when all\ntests are being conducted and when the official votes are being counted. _The\nparty designee may observe the other election systems during election\noperations, may request inspection of and photograph the system settings, may\nreceive and retain these settings in print form, and may have access to a\nhotline to report technology issues. The public must be allowed to observe all\ntabulating equipment and election equipment while in use, either through\ndirect observation or a video stream, and to request inspection of system\nsettings provided that voter privacy is maintained._ The designee _or the\npublic_ may not interfere with the normal operation of the canvassing board\n_or election operations_. _However, the designee and the public must be able\nto call a hotline when an issue is identified and submit a work ticket. The\ncalls to the hotline must be monitored by the state and the canvassing board.\nA political party may select to have the designees of the party monitor the\nhotline._\n\n_(4)_ ~~(3)~~ For electronic or electromechanical voting systems configured to\ntabulate vote-by-mail ballots at a central or regional site, the public\ntesting _must_ ~~shall~~ be conducted by processing a preaudited group of\nballots so produced as to record a predetermined number of valid votes for\neach candidate and on each measure and to include one or more ballots for each\noffice which have activated voting positions in excess of the number allowed\nby law in order to test the ability of the automatic tabulating equipment to\nreject such votes. If any error is detected, the cause therefor _must_\n~~shall~~ be corrected and an errorless count _must_ ~~shall~~ be made before\nthe automatic tabulating equipment is approved. The test _must_ ~~shall~~ be\nrepeated and errorless results achieved immediately before the start of the\nofficial count of the ballots and again after the completion of the official\ncount. The programs and ballots used for testing _must_ ~~shall~~ be sealed\nand retained under the custody of the county canvassing board. _Immediately\nafter the preaudited group of ballots is run and results reconciled, a\nrandomly selected number of test ballots from one or more public participants\nmust be chosen. After the batch of ballots provided by the public is\nreconciled, the two batches must be comingled and reconciled again. The test\nof combined public and preaudited ballots must also be repeated and errorless\nresults achieved immediately before the start of the official count of the\nballots and again after the completion of the official count._\n\n_(5)(a)1._ ~~(4)(a)1.~~ For electronic or electromechanical voting systems\nconfigured to include electronic or electromechanical tabulation devices which\nare distributed to the precincts _or used in an absentee vote counting center_\n, all ~~or a sample~~ of the devices to be used in the election _must_\n~~shall~~ be publicly tested. ~~If a sample is to be tested, the sample shall\nconsist of a random selection of at least 5 percent or 10 of the devices for\nan optical scan system, whichever is greater.~~ For touchscreen systems used\nfor voters having a disability, _all_ ~~a sample of at least 2 percent~~ of\nthe devices must be tested. The test _must_ ~~shall~~ be conducted by\nprocessing a group of _no fewer than 20_ ballots, causing the device to output\nresults for the ballots processed, and comparing the output of results to the\nresults expected for the ballots processed. The group of ballots _must_\n~~shall~~ be produced so as to record a predetermined number of valid votes\nfor each candidate and on each measure and to include for each office one or\nmore ballots which have activated voting positions in excess of the number\nallowed by law in order to test the ability of the tabulating device to reject\nsuch votes. _Immediately after the official group of test ballots is run and\nresults reconciled, a batch of up to 20 random test ballots from one or more\npublic participants must be chosen if there are more than 20 ballot\nsubmissions proposed. After the batch of ballots provided by the public is\nreconciled, the two batches must be comingled and reconciled again. The test\nof combined public and official test ballots must be repeated and errorless\nresults achieved immediately before the start of the official count of the\nballots and again after the completion of the official count._\n\n2\\. If any tested tabulating device is found to have an error in tabulation\n_or other election system is determined to have an error in its function or\nsecurity measures_ , it _must_ ~~shall~~ be deemed unsatisfactory. For each\ndevice deemed unsatisfactory _, a report on the finding must be written and be\npublicly available for review. For each device or system deemed\nunsatisfactory_ , the canvassing board _shall, with assistance from a county\nor state information technology expert,_ ~~shall~~ take steps to determine the\ncause of the error, ~~shall attempt to~~ identify and test other devices that\ncould reasonably be expected to have the same error, and shall test a number\nof additional devices sufficient to determine that all devices are\nsatisfactory. Upon deeming any device unsatisfactory, the canvassing board may\nrequire all devices to be tested or may declare that all devices are\nunsatisfactory. _The system may not allow remote logins._\n\n3\\. If the operation or output of any tested tabulation device, such as\nspelling or the order of candidates on a report, is in error, such problem\n_must_ ~~shall~~ be reported to the canvassing board. The canvassing board\nshall then determine _whether_ ~~if~~ the reported problem warrants its\ndeeming the device unsatisfactory.\n\n(b) At the completion of testing under this subsection, the canvassing board\nor its representative, the representatives of the political parties, and the\ncandidates or their representatives who attended the test shall witness the\nresetting of each device that passed to a preelection state of readiness _,_\n~~and~~ the sealing of _its USB ports and other physical ports through which\nmalware may be inserted, and the verification of its power receptacle using\ntamper evident uniquely serialized official security seals. Once sealed, the\ndevice or system must have a removable sticker placed on it which can be seen\nby public observers and employees. Such sticker must have a device or system\nidentifier and checkboxes for each test performed and passed, including\nsettings. The list of validated settings must be posted next to the test\nsticker_ ~~each device that passed in such a manner as to secure its state of\nreadiness until the opening of the polls~~.\n\n(c) The canvassing board or its representative shall execute a written\nstatement setting forth the tabulation devices _and other election systems_\ntested, the results of the testing, the protective counter numbers, if\napplicable, of each tabulation device, the number of the _seals_ ~~seal~~\nsecuring each tabulation device _or other election system_ at the conclusion\nof testing, any problems reported to the board as a result of the testing, and\nwhether each device tested is satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\n\n(d) Any tabulating device _or other election system_ deemed unsatisfactory\n_must_ ~~shall~~ be recoded, repaired, or replaced and _must_ ~~shall~~ be\nmade available for retesting. Such device must be determined by the canvassing\nboard or its representative to be satisfactory before it may be used in any\nelection. The canvassing board or its representative shall announce at the\nclose of the first testing the date, place, and time that any unsatisfactory\ndevice will be retested or may, at the option of the board, notify by\ntelephone each person who was present at the first testing as to the date,\nplace, and time that the retesting will occur.\n\n(e) Records must be kept of all preelection testing of electronic or\nelectromechanical tabulation devices _and other election systems_ used in any\nelection. Such records are to be present and available for inspection and\nreference during public preelection testing by any person in attendance during\nsuch testing _and through a public records request at no charge_. _The test\nrecords may also be posted on the election office website._ The need of the\ncanvassing board for access to such records during the testing _takes_ ~~shall\ntake~~ precedence over the need of other attendees _or the public_ to access\nsuch records so that the work of the canvassing board will not be delayed or\nhindered. Records of testing must include, for each device, the name of each\nperson who tested the device and the date, place, time, and results of each\ntest. Records of testing _must_ ~~shall~~ be retained as part of the official\nrecords of the election in which any device was used _for a period of 22\nmonths after election certification_.\n\n_(6)_ ~~(5)~~ Any tests involving marksense ballots pursuant to this section\n_must_ ~~shall~~ employ test ballots created by the supervisor of elections\nusing actual ballots that have been printed for the election. If ballot-on-\ndemand ballots will be used in the election, the supervisor _must_ ~~shall~~\nalso create test ballots using the ballot-on-demand technology that will be\nused to produce ballots in the election, using the same paper stock as will be\nused for ballots in the election.\n\nSection 15. Section 101.591, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:\n\n101.591 Voting _and other election_ system audit. --\n\n(1) _On the second day after the closing of the polls_ ~~Immediately following\nthe certification of each election~~ , the county canvassing board or the\nlocal board responsible for certifying the election shall conduct a manual\naudit _and may also conduct_ ~~or~~ an automated, independent audit of the\nvoting systems used in randomly selected precincts. _The manual audit must be\nconducted in at least one precinct for each race on the ballot, and the\nprecinct in which the race is audited must be randomly selected. The number of\nprecincts where a manual audit is conducted must be no less than 5 percent but\nno more than 10 percent of the precincts. If this results in more precincts\nthan races, the additional precincts must have a randomly selected race\naudited. If 5 percent of the precincts yields fewer than 5 precincts, the\ncounty canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying the\nelection must randomly chose at least 5 precincts. Random precincts must be\nselected using a lottery at a publicly noticed canvassing board meeting. If\nthe results of the manual audit show a discrepancy of more than the margin of\nvictory in any race, that race may not be certified until the discrepancy is\nresolved. If such discrepancy cannot be resolved, there must be a manual\nrecount of the race in all precincts._\n\n(2)(a) _For each precinct and race selected,_ a manual audit _must_ ~~shall~~\nconsist of a public manual tally of the votes cast _using original paper\nballots_ in one randomly selected race that appears on the ballot. The tally\nsheet _for the precinct must_ ~~shall~~ include election-day, vote-by-mail,\nearly voting, provisional, and overseas ballots _collected and counted through\nelection day. The canvassing board and public observers must be present for\nthe retrieval of sealed ballots, the opening of seals, and the manual recount.\nThe manual recount procedure must be videotaped and livestreamed_ ~~, in at\nleast 1 percent but no more than 2 percent of the precincts chosen at random\nby the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying\nthe election~~. ~~If 1 percent of the precincts is less than one entire\nprecinct, the audit shall be conducted using at least one precinct chosen at\nrandom by the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for\ncertifying the election. Such precincts shall be selected at a publicly\nnoticed canvassing board meeting.~~\n\n(b) An automated audit _must_ ~~shall~~ consist of a public automated tally of\nthe votes cast across every race that appears on the ballot _and must use the\noriginal paper ballots_. The tally sheet _must_ ~~shall~~ include election\nday, vote-by-mail, early voting, provisional, and overseas ballots in at least\n20 percent of the precincts chosen at random by the county canvassing board or\nthe local board responsible for certifying the election. Such precincts _must_\n~~shall~~ be _randomly_ selected at a publicly noticed canvassing board\nmeeting.\n\n(c) The division shall adopt rules for approval of an independent audit system\nwhich provide that the system, at a minimum, must be:\n\n1\\. Completely independent of the primary voting system.\n\n2\\. Fast enough to produce final audit results within the timeframe prescribed\nin subsection (4).\n\n3\\. Capable of demonstrating that the ballots of record have been accurately\nadjudicated by the audit system.\n\n(3) The canvassing board shall post a notice of the audit, including the date,\ntime, and place, in four conspicuous places in the county and on the home page\nof the county supervisor of elections website.\n\n(4) The audit must be completed and the results made public _before_ ~~no\nlater than 11:59 p.m. on the 7th day following~~ certification of the election\nby the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying\nthe election.\n\n(5) By December 15 of each general election year, the county canvassing board\nor the board responsible for certifying the election shall provide a report\nwith the results of the audit to the Department of State in a standard format\nas prescribed by the department. The report must be consolidated into one\nreport with the overvote and undervote report required under s. 101.595(1).\nThe report _must_ ~~shall~~ contain, but is not limited to, the following\nitems:\n\n(a) The overall accuracy of audit.\n\n(b) A description of any problems or discrepancies encountered.\n\n(c) The likely cause of such problems or discrepancies.\n\n(d) Recommended corrective action with respect to avoiding or mitigating such\ncircumstances in future elections.\n\n(6) If a manual recount is undertaken pursuant to s. 102.166, the canvassing\nboard is not required to perform the audit provided for in this section.\n\nSection 16. Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 101.68, Florida\nStatutes, is amended to read:\n\n101.68 Canvassing of vote-by-mail ballot. --\n\n(2)(a) The county canvassing board may begin the canvassing of vote-by-mail\nballots upon the completion of the public testing of automatic tabulating\nequipment pursuant to _s. 101.5612(3)_ ~~s. 101.5612(2)~~ , but must begin\nsuch canvassing by no later than noon on the day following the election.\nHowever, notwithstanding any such authorization to begin canvassing or\notherwise processing vote-by-mail ballots early, no result shall be released\nuntil after the closing of the polls in that county on election day. Any\nsupervisor, deputy supervisor, canvassing board member, election board member,\nor election employee who releases the results of a canvassing or processing of\nvote-by mail ballots prior to the closing of the polls in that county on\nelection day commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in\ns. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.\n\nSection 17.

The canvassing board\nshall then determine _whether_ ~~if~~ the reported problem warrants its\ndeeming the device unsatisfactory.\n\n(b) At the completion of testing under this subsection, the canvassing board\nor its representative, the representatives of the political parties, and the\ncandidates or their representatives who attended the test shall witness the\nresetting of each device that passed to a preelection state of readiness _,_\n~~and~~ the sealing of _its USB ports and other physical ports through which\nmalware may be inserted, and the verification of its power receptacle using\ntamper evident uniquely serialized official security seals. Once sealed, the\ndevice or system must have a removable sticker placed on it which can be seen\nby public observers and employees. Such sticker must have a device or system\nidentifier and checkboxes for each test performed and passed, including\nsettings. The list of validated settings must be posted next to the test\nsticker_ ~~each device that passed in such a manner as to secure its state of\nreadiness until the opening of the polls~~.\n\n(c) The canvassing board or its representative shall execute a written\nstatement setting forth the tabulation devices _and other election systems_\ntested, the results of the testing, the protective counter numbers, if\napplicable, of each tabulation device, the number of the _seals_ ~~seal~~\nsecuring each tabulation device _or other election system_ at the conclusion\nof testing, any problems reported to the board as a result of the testing, and\nwhether each device tested is satisfactory or unsatisfactory.\n\n(d) Any tabulating device _or other election system_ deemed unsatisfactory\n_must_ ~~shall~~ be recoded, repaired, or replaced and _must_ ~~shall~~ be\nmade available for retesting. Such device must be determined by the canvassing\nboard or its representative to be satisfactory before it may be used in any\nelection. The canvassing board or its representative shall announce at the\nclose of the first testing the date, place, and time that any unsatisfactory\ndevice will be retested or may, at the option of the board, notify by\ntelephone each person who was present at the first testing as to the date,\nplace, and time that the retesting will occur.\n\n(e) Records must be kept of all preelection testing of electronic or\nelectromechanical tabulation devices _and other election systems_ used in any\nelection. Such records are to be present and available for inspection and\nreference during public preelection testing by any person in attendance during\nsuch testing _and through a public records request at no charge_. _The test\nrecords may also be posted on the election office website._ The need of the\ncanvassing board for access to such records during the testing _takes_ ~~shall\ntake~~ precedence over the need of other attendees _or the public_ to access\nsuch records so that the work of the canvassing board will not be delayed or\nhindered. Records of testing must include, for each device, the name of each\nperson who tested the device and the date, place, time, and results of each\ntest. Records of testing _must_ ~~shall~~ be retained as part of the official\nrecords of the election in which any device was used _for a period of 22\nmonths after election certification_.\n\n_(6)_ ~~(5)~~ Any tests involving marksense ballots pursuant to this section\n_must_ ~~shall~~ employ test ballots created by the supervisor of elections\nusing actual ballots that have been printed for the election. If ballot-on-\ndemand ballots will be used in the election, the supervisor _must_ ~~shall~~\nalso create test ballots using the ballot-on-demand technology that will be\nused to produce ballots in the election, using the same paper stock as will be\nused for ballots in the election.\n\nSection 15. Section 101.591, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:\n\n101.591 Voting _and other election_ system audit. --\n\n(1) _On the second day after the closing of the polls_ ~~Immediately following\nthe certification of each election~~ , the county canvassing board or the\nlocal board responsible for certifying the election shall conduct a manual\naudit _and may also conduct_ ~~or~~ an automated, independent audit of the\nvoting systems used in randomly selected precincts. _The manual audit must be\nconducted in at least one precinct for each race on the ballot, and the\nprecinct in which the race is audited must be randomly selected. The number of\nprecincts where a manual audit is conducted must be no less than 5 percent but\nno more than 10 percent of the precincts. If this results in more precincts\nthan races, the additional precincts must have a randomly selected race\naudited. If 5 percent of the precincts yields fewer than 5 precincts, the\ncounty canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying the\nelection must randomly chose at least 5 precincts. Random precincts must be\nselected using a lottery at a publicly noticed canvassing board meeting. If\nthe results of the manual audit show a discrepancy of more than the margin of\nvictory in any race, that race may not be certified until the discrepancy is\nresolved. If such discrepancy cannot be resolved, there must be a manual\nrecount of the race in all precincts._\n\n(2)(a) _For each precinct and race selected,_ a manual audit _must_ ~~shall~~\nconsist of a public manual tally of the votes cast _using original paper\nballots_ in one randomly selected race that appears on the ballot. The tally\nsheet _for the precinct must_ ~~shall~~ include election-day, vote-by-mail,\nearly voting, provisional, and overseas ballots _collected and counted through\nelection day. The canvassing board and public observers must be present for\nthe retrieval of sealed ballots, the opening of seals, and the manual recount.\nThe manual recount procedure must be videotaped and livestreamed_ ~~, in at\nleast 1 percent but no more than 2 percent of the precincts chosen at random\nby the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying\nthe election~~. ~~If 1 percent of the precincts is less than one entire\nprecinct, the audit shall be conducted using at least one precinct chosen at\nrandom by the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for\ncertifying the election. Such precincts shall be selected at a publicly\nnoticed canvassing board meeting.~~\n\n(b) An automated audit _must_ ~~shall~~ consist of a public automated tally of\nthe votes cast across every race that appears on the ballot _and must use the\noriginal paper ballots_. The tally sheet _must_ ~~shall~~ include election\nday, vote-by-mail, early voting, provisional, and overseas ballots in at least\n20 percent of the precincts chosen at random by the county canvassing board or\nthe local board responsible for certifying the election. Such precincts _must_\n~~shall~~ be _randomly_ selected at a publicly noticed canvassing board\nmeeting.\n\n(c) The division shall adopt rules for approval of an independent audit system\nwhich provide that the system, at a minimum, must be:\n\n1\\. Completely independent of the primary voting system.\n\n2\\. Fast enough to produce final audit results within the timeframe prescribed\nin subsection (4).\n\n3\\. Capable of demonstrating that the ballots of record have been accurately\nadjudicated by the audit system.\n\n(3) The canvassing board shall post a notice of the audit, including the date,\ntime, and place, in four conspicuous places in the county and on the home page\nof the county supervisor of elections website.\n\n(4) The audit must be completed and the results made public _before_ ~~no\nlater than 11:59 p.m. on the 7th day following~~ certification of the election\nby the county canvassing board or the local board responsible for certifying\nthe election.\n\n(5) By December 15 of each general election year, the county canvassing board\nor the board responsible for certifying the election shall provide a report\nwith the results of the audit to the Department of State in a standard format\nas prescribed by the department. The report must be consolidated into one\nreport with the overvote and undervote report required under s. 101.595(1).\nThe report _must_ ~~shall~~ contain, but is not limited to, the following\nitems:\n\n(a) The overall accuracy of audit.\n\n(b) A description of any problems or discrepancies encountered.\n\n(c) The likely cause of such problems or discrepancies.\n\n(d) Recommended corrective action with respect to avoiding or mitigating such\ncircumstances in future elections.\n\n(6) If a manual recount is undertaken pursuant to s. 102.166, the canvassing\nboard is not required to perform the audit provided for in this section.\n\nSection 16. Paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 101.68, Florida\nStatutes, is amended to read:\n\n101.68 Canvassing of vote-by-mail ballot. --\n\n(2)(a) The county canvassing board may begin the canvassing of vote-by-mail\nballots upon the completion of the public testing of automatic tabulating\nequipment pursuant to _s. 101.5612(3)_ ~~s. 101.5612(2)~~ , but must begin\nsuch canvassing by no later than noon on the day following the election.\nHowever, notwithstanding any such authorization to begin canvassing or\notherwise processing vote-by-mail ballots early, no result shall be released\nuntil after the closing of the polls in that county on election day. Any\nsupervisor, deputy supervisor, canvassing board member, election board member,\nor election employee who releases the results of a canvassing or processing of\nvote-by mail ballots prior to the closing of the polls in that county on\nelection day commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in\ns. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084.\n\nSection 17.
