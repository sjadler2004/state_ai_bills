The failure of an insurer to properly deliver the Homeowner Claims Bill of Rights is subject to administrative enforcement by the office but is not admissible as evidence in a civil action against an insurer. The Homeowner Claims Bill of Rights does not enlarge, modify, or contravene statutory requirements, including, but not limited to, ss. 626.854, 626.9541, 627.70131, 627.7015, and 627.7074, and does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to repair damaged property in compliance with the terms of an applicable policy or ss. 627.7011(6)(e) and <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">627.702(8)</u>\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">627.702(7)</strike>.

In furtherance of such legislative intent, when a loss\nwas caused in part by a covered peril and in part by a noncovered peril,\nparagraph (a) does not apply. In such circumstances, the insurer's liability\nunder this section shall be limited to the amount of the loss caused by the\ncovered peril.

Nor does this\nsection apply to coverage of an appurtenant structure or other structure or\nany coverage or claim in which the dollar amount of coverage available as to\nthe structure involved is not directly stated in the policy as a dollar amount\nspecifically applicable to that particular structure.\n\n_(7)_ ~~(6)~~ With regard to mobile homes included in subsection _(2)_ ~~(1)~~\n, any total loss shall be adjusted on the basis of the amount of money for\nwhich such property was insured as specified in the policy, whether on an\nactual cash value basis, replacement cost basis, or stated amount, and for\nwhich a premium has been charged and paid only if the insured has elected to\npurchase such coverage at the inception of the policy.

Such repair or replacement of\ndamaged property shall be in lieu of any liability created by subsection _(2)_\n~~(1)~~ ; and any insurer so repairing or replacing shall have no liability\npursuant to subsection _(2)_ ~~(1)~~ , provided such insurer returns to the\nnamed insured a portion of the premium, for all policy terms during which the\npolicy limits were the same as those in effect on the date on which the loss\noccurred, equal to that portion of the premium paid for limits of insurance on\nthe structure in excess of the cost of replacement.\n\n_(9)_ ~~(8)~~ Any property insurer may, by an appropriate rider or endorsement\nor otherwise, provide insurance indemnifying the insured for the difference\nbetween the insurable value of the insured property at the time any loss or\ndamage occurs, and the amount actually expended to repair, rebuild, or replace\nwithin this state, with new materials of like size, kind, and quality, such\nproperty as has been damaged or destroyed.\n\n**Section 4.

Section 627.7142, Florida Statutes, is amended to read:**\n\n627.7142 Homeowner Claims Bill of Rights.--An insurer issuing a personal lines\nresidential property insurance policy in this state must provide a Homeowner\nClaims Bill of Rights to a policyholder within 14 days after receiving an\ninitial communication with respect to a claim. The purpose of the bill of\nrights is to summarize, in simple, nontechnical terms, existing Florida law\nregarding the rights of a personal lines residential property insurance\npolicyholder who files a claim of loss. The Homeowner Claims Bill of Rights is\nspecific to the claims process and does not represent all of a policyholder's\nrights under Florida law regarding the insurance policy. The Homeowner Claims\nBill of Rights does not create a civil cause of action by any individual\npolicyholder or class of policyholders against an insurer or insurers. The\nfailure of an insurer to properly deliver the Homeowner Claims Bill of Rights\nis subject to administrative enforcement by the office but is not admissible\nas evidence in a civil action against an insurer. The Homeowner Claims Bill of\nRights does not enlarge, modify, or contravene statutory requirements,\nincluding, but not limited to, ss. 626.854, 626.9541, 627.70131, 627.7015, and\n627.7074, and does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to repair\ndamaged property in compliance with the terms of an applicable policy or ss.\n627.7011(6)(e) and _627.702(8)_ ~~627.702(7)~~.
