A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized pursuant to this\nsubsection at any time by submitting a request to a controller specifying the\nconsumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke. A known child's parent or legal\nguardian may invoke such consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding\nprocessing personal data belonging to the known child. A controller shall\ncomply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right:\n\n1\\. To confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's\npersonal data and to access such personal data;\n\n2\\. To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into\naccount the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of\nthe consumer's personal data;\n\n3\\. To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;\n\n4\\. To obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer\npreviously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent\ntechnically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to\ntransmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the\nprocessing is carried out by automated means; and\n\n5\\. To opt out of the processing of ~~the~~ personal data for purposes of (i)\ntargeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal data, or (iii) profiling in\nfurtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects\nconcerning the consumer. _A consumer may authorize a third party, acting on\nthe consumer 's behalf, to opt out of the processing of the consumer's\npersonal data for the purposes described in this subdivision. Such\nauthorization may be made using technology that indicates the consumer's\nintent to opt out, including a browser setting, browser extension, global\ndevice setting, or other user-selected universal opt-out mechanism. For the\npurposes of this subdivision, the user-selected universal opt-out mechanism\nshall:_\n\n_a. Not unfairly disadvantage a controller;_\n\n_b. Require the consumer to make an affirmative, freely given, and unambiguous\nchoice to opt out of any processing of a consumer 's personal data;_\n\n_c. Be easy to use by the average consumer;_\n\n_d. Be consistent with state and federal laws and regulations; and_\n\n_e. Allow the controller to accurately determine whether the consumer has made\na legitimate request to opt out under this subdivision 5._\n\nB. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply\nwith a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights authorized\npursuant to subsection A as follows:\n\n1\\. A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all\ncases within 45 days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to the\nmethods described in subsection A. The response period may be extended once by\n45 additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the\ncomplexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as the controller\ninforms the consumer of any such extension within the initial 45-day response\nperiod, together with the reason for the extension.\n\n2\\. If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request,\nthe controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases\nand at the latest within 45 days of receipt of the request, of the\njustification for declining to take action and instructions for how to appeal\nthe decision pursuant to subsection C.\n\n3\\. Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided\nby a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer. If requests\nfrom a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the\ncontroller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the\nadministrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the\nrequest. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly\nunfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the request.\n\n4\\. If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially\nreasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a\nrequest to initiate an action under subsection A and may request that the\nconsumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate\nthe consumer and the consumer's request.\n\n5\\. A controller that has obtained personal data about a consumer from a\nsource other than the consumer shall be deemed in compliance with a consumer's\nrequest to delete such data pursuant to subdivision A 3 by either (i)\nretaining a record of the deletion request and the minimum data necessary for\nthe purpose of ensuring the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the\nbusiness's records and not using such retained data for any other purpose\npursuant to the provisions of this chapter or (ii) opting the consumer out of\nthe processing of such personal data for any purpose except for those exempted\npursuant to the provisions of this chapter.\n\n_6\\. If a consumer 's decision to authorize a third party to act on his behalf\nto opt out of the processing of his personal data pursuant to subdivision A 5\nconflicts with the consumer's existing privacy setting with a controller or\nvoluntary participation in a controller's bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium\nfeatures, discounts, or club card program, the controller shall comply with\nthe consumer's opt-out but may notify the consumer of the conflict and provide\nthe consumer with the choice to confirm his preferred privacy setting._\n\n_7\\. If a controller charges a fee for the use of a user-selected universal\nopt-out mechanism as described in subdivision A 5, the controller shall inform\na consumer attempting to use such mechanism of such fee._\n\nC. A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the\ncontroller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of\ntime after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subdivision B 2.\nThe appeal process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process\nfor submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection A. Within 60\ndays of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in\nwriting of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including\na written explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is\ndenied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online\nmechanism, if available, or other method through which the consumer may\ncontact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.\n\n**§ 59.1-578. Data controller responsibilities; transparency.**\n\nA. A controller shall:\n\n1\\. Limit the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant, and\nreasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is\nprocessed, as disclosed to the consumer;\n\n2\\. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data\nfor purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the\ndisclosed purposes for which such personal data is processed, as disclosed to\nthe consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;\n\n3\\. Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical,\nand physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and accessibility of personal data. Such data security practices\nshall be appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue;\n\n4\\. Not process personal data in violation of state and federal laws that\nprohibit unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not\ndiscriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights\ncontained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging\ndifferent prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different\nlevel of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However, nothing in\nthis subdivision shall be construed to require a controller to provide a\nproduct or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the\ncontroller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from\noffering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or\nservices to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if\nthe consumer has exercised his right to opt out pursuant to § 59.1-577 or the\noffer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide\nloyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; and\n\n5\\. Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer _, including an\nadolescent consumer,_ without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the\ncase of the processing of sensitive data concerning a known child, without\nprocessing such data in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy\nProtection Act (15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.).\n\nB. Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive\nor limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to § 59.1-577 shall be deemed\ncontrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.\n\nC. Controllers shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible, clear,\nand meaningful privacy notice that includes:\n\n1\\. The categories of personal data processed by the controller;\n\n2\\. The purpose for processing personal data;\n\n3\\. How consumers may exercise their consumer rights pursuant § 59.1-577,\nincluding how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with regard to the\nconsumer's request;\n\n4\\. The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third\nparties, if any; and\n\n5\\. The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares\npersonal data.\n\nD. If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal\ndata for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously\ndisclose such processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may\nexercise the right to opt out of such processing.\n\nE. A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one\nor more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to\nexercise their consumer rights under this chapter. Such means shall take into\naccount the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the\nneed for secure and reliable communication of such requests, and the ability\nof the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the\nrequest. Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in\norder to exercise consumer rights pursuant to § 59.1-577 but may require a\nconsumer to use an existing account.\n\nF. 1. Subject to the consent requirement established by subdivision 3, no\ncontroller shall process any personal data collected from a known child:\n\na. For the purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of such\npersonal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce\nlegal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer;\n\nb. Unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online\nservice, product, or feature;\n\nc. For any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the\ncontroller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data\nor that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed\npurpose; or\n\nd. For longer than is reasonably necessary to provide the online service,\nproduct, or feature.\n\n2\\. Subject to the consent requirement established by subdivision 3, no\ncontroller shall collect precise geolocation data from a known child unless\n(i) such precise geolocation data is reasonably necessary for the controller\nto provide an online service, product, or feature and, if such data is\nnecessary to provide such online service, product, or feature, such controller\nshall only collect such data for the time necessary to provide such online\nservice, product, or feature and (ii) the controller provides to the known\nchild a signal indicating that such controller is collecting such precise\ngeolocation data, which signal shall be available to such known child for the\nentire duration of such collection.\n\n3\\. No controller shall engage in the activities described in subdivisions 1\nor 2 unless the controller obtains consent from the child's parent or legal\nguardian in accordance with the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection\nAct (15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.).\n\n_G. 1. Subject to the consent requirement established by subdivision 3 and\nwhere a controller has actual knowledge or willfully disregards that a\nconsumer is an adolescent, no controller shall process any personal data\ncollected from such adolescent:_\n\n_a. For the purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of such\npersonal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce\nlegal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer;_\n\n_b. Unless such processing is reasonably necessary to provide the online\nservice, product, or feature;_\n\n_c. For any processing purpose other than the processing purpose that the\ncontroller disclosed at the time such controller collected such personal data\nor that is reasonably necessary for and compatible with such disclosed\npurpose; or_\n\n_d.
