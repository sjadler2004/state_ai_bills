Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, a custodial interrogation\nmay be conducted (i) if the child's parent, guardian, or legal custodian is a\ncodefendant in the alleged offense; (ii) if the child's parent, guardian, or\nlegal custodian has been arrested for, has been charged with, or is being\ninvestigated for a crime against the child; (iii) if, after every reasonable\neffort has been made to comply with subsection A, the child's parent,\nguardian, or legal custodian cannot be located or refuses contact with the\nchild; or (iv) if the law-enforcement officer conducting the custodial\ninterrogation reasonably believes the information sought is necessary to\nprotect life, limb, or property from an imminent danger and the law-\nenforcement officer's questions are limited to those that are reasonably\nnecessary to obtain such information.\n\nC. _A law-enforcement officer shall be prohibited from knowingly and\nintentionally making false statements about any known material fact, including\nby use of inauthentic replica documents, prior to or during a custodial\ninterrogation of a child in order to secure the cooperation, confession, or\nconviction of such child. As used in this subsection, \"inauthentic replica\ndocuments\" means any documents, including computer-generated documents,\ncreated by any means, including artificial intelligence, by a law-enforcement\nofficer or his agent that (i) contain a false statement, signature, seal,\nletterhead, or contact information or (ii) materially misrepresent any fact._\n\n_D._ Except as provided in subsection B, if a law-enforcement officer\nknowingly violates the provisions of subsection A _or C_ , any statements made\nby such child shall be inadmissible in any delinquency proceeding or criminal\nproceeding against such child, unless the attorney for the Commonwealth proves\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the statement was made knowingly,\nintelligently, and voluntarily.\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
