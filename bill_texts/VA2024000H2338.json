Standard 1. Instructional programs supporting the Standards of Learning and other educational objectives.</b>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The General Assembly and the Board believe that the fundamental goal of the public schools of the Commonwealth must be to enable each student to develop the skills that are necessary for success in school, preparation for life, and reaching their full potential. The General Assembly and the Board find that the quality of education is dependent upon the provision of (i) the appropriate working environment, benefits, and salaries necessary to ensure the availability of high-quality instructional personnel; (ii) the appropriate learning environment designed to promote student achievement; (iii) quality instruction that enables each student to become a productive and educated citizen of Virginia and the United States of America; and (iv) the adequate commitment of other resources. In keeping with this goal, the General Assembly shall provide for the support of public education as set forth in Article VIII, &sect; 1 of the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board shall establish educational objectives known as the Standards of Learning, which shall form the core of Virginia&#39;s educational program, and other educational objectives, which together are designed to ensure the development of the skills that are necessary for success in school and for preparation for life in the years beyond. At a minimum, the Board shall establish Standards of Learning for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science. The Standards of Learning shall not be construed to be regulations as defined in &sect; 2.2-4001.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall seek to ensure that the Standards of Learning are consistent with a high-quality foundation educational program. The Standards of Learning shall include, but not be limited to, the basic skills of communication (listening, speaking, reading, and writing); computation and critical reasoning, including problem solving and decision making; proficiency in the use of computers and related technology; computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding; and the skills to manage personal finances and to make sound financial decisions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The English Standards of Learning for reading in kindergarten through grade eight shall align with evidence-based literacy instruction and science-based reading research.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Standards of Learning in all subject areas shall be subject to regular review and revision to maintain rigor and to reflect a balance between content knowledge and the application of knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning. The Board shall establish a regular schedule, in a manner it deems appropriate, for the review, and revision as may be necessary, of the Standards of Learning in all subject areas. Such review of each subject area shall occur at least once every seven years. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Board from conducting such review and revision on a more frequent basis.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">To provide appropriate opportunity for input from the general public, teachers, and local school boards, the Board shall conduct public hearings prior to establishing revised Standards of Learning. Thirty days prior to conducting such hearings, the Board shall give notice of the date, time, and place of the hearings to all local school boards and any other persons requesting to be notified of the hearings and publish notice of its intention to revise the Standards of Learning in the Virginia Register of Regulations. Interested parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to be heard and present information prior to final adoption of any revisions of the Standards of Learning.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Department shall make available and maintain a website, either separately or through an existing website utilized by the Department, enabling public elementary, middle, and high school educators to submit recommendations for improvements relating to the Standards of Learning, when under review by the Board according to its established schedule, and related assessments required by the Standards of Quality pursuant to this chapter. Such website shall facilitate the submission of recommendations by educators.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">School boards shall implement the Standards of Learning or objectives specifically designed for their school divisions that are equivalent to or exceed the Board&#39;s requirements. Students shall be expected to achieve the educational objectives established by the school division at appropriate age or grade levels. The curriculum adopted by the local school division shall be aligned to the Standards of Learning.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall include in the Standards of Learning for history and social science the study of contributions to society of diverse people. For the purposes of this subsection, &quot;diverse&quot; includes consideration of disability, ethnicity, race, and gender.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall include in the Standards of Learning for health instruction in emergency first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and the use of an automated external defibrillator, including hands-on practice of the skills necessary to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Such instruction shall be based on the current national evidence-based emergency cardiovascular care guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of an automated external defibrillator, such as a program developed by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross. No teacher who is in compliance with subdivision D 3 of &sect; 22.1-298.1 shall be required to be certified as a trainer of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to provide instruction for non-certification.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall include in the Standards of Learning for physical and health education for grade nine or 10 research-based hazing prevention instruction, in accordance with the Standards of Learning and curriculum guidelines for research-based hazing prevention instruction developed by the Board pursuant to subsection B of &sect; 22.1-207.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">With such funds as are made available for this purpose, the Board shall regularly review and revise the competencies for career and technical education programs to require the full integration of English, mathematics, science, and history and social science Standards of Learning. Career and technical education programs shall be aligned with industry and professional standard certifications, where they exist.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall establish content standards and curriculum guidelines for courses in career investigation in elementary school, middle school, and high school. Each school board shall (i) require each middle school student to take at least one course in career investigation or (ii) select an alternate means of delivering the career investigation course to each middle school student, provided that such alternative is equivalent in content and rigor and provides the foundation for such students to develop their academic and career plans. Any school board may require (a) such courses in career investigation at the high school level as it deems appropriate, subject to Board approval as required in subsection A of &sect; 22.1-253.13:4, and (b) such courses in career investigation at the elementary school level as it deems appropriate. The Board shall develop and disseminate to each school board career investigation resource materials that are designed to ensure that students have the ability to further explore interest in career and technical education opportunities in middle and high school. In developing such resource materials, the Board shall consult with representatives of career and technical education, industry, skilled trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar organizations, and contractor organizations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Local school boards shall develop and implement a program of instruction for grades K through 12 that is aligned to the Standards of Learning and meets or exceeds the requirements of the Board. The program of instruction shall emphasize reading, writing, speaking, mathematical concepts and computations, proficiency in the use of computers and related technology, computer science and computational thinking, including computer coding, and scientific concepts and processes; essential skills and concepts of citizenship, including knowledge of Virginia history and world and United States history, economics, government, foreign languages, international cultures, health and physical education, environmental issues, and geography necessary for responsible participation in American society and in the international community; fine arts, which may include, but need not be limited to, music and art, and practical arts; knowledge and skills needed to qualify for further education, gainful employment, or training in a career or technical field; and development of the ability to apply such skills and knowledge in preparation for eventual employment and lifelong learning and to achieve economic self-sufficiency.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Local school boards shall also develop and implement programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation for students who are educationally at risk including, but not limited to, those who fail to achieve a passing score on any Standards of Learning assessment in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs shall include components that are research-based.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Any student who achieves a passing score on one or more, but not all, of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight may be required to attend a remediation program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Any student who fails to achieve a passing score on all of the Standards of Learning assessments for the relevant grade level in grades three through eight or who fails an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit shall be required to attend a remediation program or to participate in another form of remediation. Division superintendents shall require such students to take special programs of prevention, intervention, or remediation, which may include attendance in public summer school programs, in accordance with clause (ii) of subsection A of &sect; 22.1-254 and &sect; 22.1-254.01.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Remediation programs shall include, when applicable, a procedure for early identification of students who are at risk of failing the Standards of Learning assessments in grades three through eight or who fail an end-of-course test required for the award of a verified unit of credit. Such programs may also include summer school for all elementary and middle school grades and for all high school academic courses, as defined by regulations promulgated by the Board, or other forms of remediation. Summer school remediation programs or other forms of remediation shall be chosen by the division superintendent to be appropriate to the academic needs of the student. Students who are required to attend such summer school programs or to participate in another form of remediation shall not be charged tuition by the school division.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The requirement for remediation may, however, be satisfied by the student&#39;s attendance in a program of prevention, intervention or remediation that has been selected by his parent, in consultation with the division superintendent or his designee, and is either (i) conducted by an accredited private school or (ii) a special program that has been determined to be comparable to the required public school remediation program by the division superintendent. The costs of such private school remediation program or other special remediation program shall be borne by the student&#39;s parent.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall establish standards for full funding of summer remedial programs that shall include, but not be limited to, the minimum number of instructional hours or the equivalent thereof required for full funding and an assessment system designed to evaluate program effectiveness. Based on the number of students attending and the Commonwealth&#39;s share of the per pupil instructional costs, state funds shall be provided for the full cost of summer and other remediation programs as set forth in the appropriation act, provided such programs comply with such standards as shall be established by the Board, pursuant to &sect; 22.1-199.2.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. Local school boards shall also implement the following:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1. Programs in grades K through three that emphasize developmentally appropriate learning to enhance success.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2.

Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards, assessments, and releases from state regulations.</b>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (&sect; 2.2-4000 et seq.), which shall include (i) student outcome and growth measures, (ii) requirements and guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of educational technology into such instructional programs, (iii) administrative and instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff positions for supporting educational technology, (iv) student services, (v) auxiliary education programs such as library and media services, (vi) requirements for graduation from high school, (vii) community relations, and (viii) the philosophy, goals, and objectives of public education in the Commonwealth.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for accreditation of public virtual schools under the authority of the local school board that enroll students full time.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board&#39;s regulations establishing standards for accreditation shall ensure that the accreditation process is transparent and based on objective measurements and that any appeal of the accreditation status of a school is heard and decided by the Board.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the Commonwealth. The Board shall review the accreditation status of a school once every three years if the school has been fully accredited for three consecutive years. Upon such triennial review, the Board shall review the accreditation status of the school for each individual year within that triennial review period. If the Board finds that the school would have been accredited every year of that triennial review period the Board shall accredit the school for another three years. The Board may review the accreditation status of any other school once every two years or once every three years, provided that any school that receives a multiyear accreditation status other than full accreditation shall be covered by a Board-approved multiyear corrective action plan for the duration of the period of accreditation. Such multiyear corrective action plan shall include annual written progress updates to the Board. A multiyear accreditation status shall not relieve any school or division of annual reporting requirements.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Each local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited pursuant to the standards for accreditation as prescribed by the Board. Each local school board shall report the accreditation status of all schools in the local school division annually in public session.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall establish a review process to assist any school that does not meet the standards established by the Board. The relevant school board shall report the results of such review and any annual progress reports in public session and shall implement any actions identified through such review and utilize them for improvement planning.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall establish a corrective action plan process for any school that does not meet the standards established by the Board. Such process shall require (a) each school board to submit a corrective action plan for any school in the local school division that does not meet the standards established by the Board and (b) any school board that fails to demonstrate progress in developing or implementing any such corrective action plan to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Board.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">When the Board determines through its review process that the failure of schools within a division to meet the standards established by the Board is related to division-level failure to implement the Standards of Quality or other division-level action or inaction, the Board may require a division-level academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time specified by the Board, each school board shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Board and shall subsequently submit to the Board for approval a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria established by the Board setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that schools within its school division meet the standards established by the Board. If the Board determines that the proposed corrective action plan is not sufficient to enable all schools within the division to meet the standards established by the Board, the Board may return the plan to the local school board with directions to submit an amended plan pursuant to Board guidance. Such corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division&#39;s comprehensive plan pursuant to &sect; 22.1-253.13:6.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The Superintendent shall develop, subject to revision by the Board, criteria for determining and recognizing educational performance in the Commonwealth&#39;s local school divisions and public schools. The portion of such criteria that measures individual student growth shall become an integral part of the accreditation process for schools in which any grade level in the grade three through eight range is taught. The Superintendent shall annually report to the Board on the accreditation status of all school divisions and schools. Such report shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of public education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and recommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning uniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance and individual student growth in the school divisions, the Board shall include consideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of dual enrollments <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">and concurrent enrollments</u> and students in Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in academic year Governor&#39;s Schools.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Superintendent shall assist local school boards in the implementation of action plans for increasing educational performance and individual student growth in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not meeting the approved criteria. The Superintendent shall monitor the implementation of and report to the Board on the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school divisions and schools.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board shall prescribe assessment methods to determine the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall evaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills related to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall, with the assistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and validation process for these assessments. In lieu of a one-time end-of-year assessment, the Board shall establish, for the purpose of providing measures of individual student growth over the course of the school year, a through-year growth assessment system, aligned with the Standards of Learning, for the administration of reading and mathematics assessments in grades three through eight. Such through-year growth assessment system shall include at least one beginning-of-year, one mid-year, and one end-of-year assessment in order to provide individual student growth scores over the course of the school year, but the total time scheduled for taking all such assessments shall not exceed 150 percent of the time scheduled for taking a single end-of-year proficiency assessment. The Department shall ensure adequate training for teachers and principals on how to interpret and use student growth data from such assessments to improve reading and mathematics instruction in grades three through eight throughout the school year. With such funds and content as are available for such purpose, such through-year growth assessment system shall provide accurate measurement of a student&#39;s performance, through computer adaptive technology, using test items at, below, and above the student&#39;s grade level as necessary.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state licensure examinations as a student-selected credit.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Department shall make available to school divisions Standards of Learning assessments typically administered by high schools by December 1 of the school year in which such assessments are to be administered or when newly developed assessments are available, whichever is later.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner and as soon as practicable following the administration of such tests, so long as the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or deplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent tests, or limit the ability to test students on demand and provide immediate results in the web-based assessment system.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall prescribe alternative methods of Standards of Learning assessment administration for children with disabilities, as that term is defined in &sect; 22.1-213, who meet criteria established by the Board to demonstrate achievement of the Standards of Learning. An eligible student&#39;s Individual Education Program team shall make the final determination as to whether an alternative method of administration is appropriate for the student.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall include in the student outcome and growth measures that are required by the standards of accreditation the required assessments for various grade levels and classes, including the completion of the alternative assessments implemented by each local school board, in accordance with the Standards of Learning. These assessments shall include end-of-course or end-of-grade tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social science and may be integrated to include multiple subject areas.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Standards of Learning assessments administered to students in grades three through eight shall not exceed (i) reading and mathematics in grades three and four; (ii) reading, mathematics, and science in grade five; (iii) reading and mathematics in grades six and seven; (iv) reading, writing, and mathematics in grade eight; (v) science after the student receives instruction in the grade six science, life science, and physical science Standards of Learning and before the student completes grade eight; and (vi) Virginia Studies and Civics and Economics once each at the grade levels deemed appropriate by each local school board. The reading and mathematics assessments administered to students in grades three through eight shall be through-year growth assessments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Each school board shall annually certify that it has provided instruction and administered an alternative assessment, consistent with Board guidelines, to students in grades three through eight in each Standards of Learning subject area in which a Standards of Learning assessment was not administered during the school year. Such guidelines shall (a) incorporate options for age-appropriate, authentic performance assessments and portfolios with rubrics and other methodologies designed to ensure that students are making adequate academic progress in the subject area and that the Standards of Learning content is being taught; (b) permit and encourage integrated assessments that include multiple subject areas; and (c) emphasize collaboration between teachers to administer and substantiate the assessments and the professional development of teachers to enable them to make the best use of alternative assessments.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Local school divisions shall provide targeted mathematics remediation and intervention to students in grades six through eight who show computational deficiencies as demonstrated by their individual performance on any diagnostic test or grade-level Standards of Learning mathematics test that measures non-calculator computational skills.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Department shall award recovery credit to any student in grades three through eight who performs below grade level on a Standards of Learning assessment in English reading or mathematics, receives remediation, and subsequently retakes and performs at or above grade level on such an assessment, including any such student who subsequently retakes such an assessment on an expedited basis.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">In addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board shall (1) develop appropriate assessments, which may include criterion-referenced tests and other assessment instruments that may be used by classroom teachers; (2) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure examinations; and (3) prescribe and provide measures, which may include nationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the bottom quartile at selected grade levels.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Standards of Learning requirements, including all related assessments, shall be waived for any student awarded a scholarship under the Brown v. Board of Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to &sect; 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a preparation program for a high school equivalency examination approved by the Board or in an adult basic education program or an adult secondary education program to obtain the high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Department shall develop processes for informing school divisions of changes in the Standards of Learning.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use of any Standards of Learning test or tests in a content area as applied to accreditation ratings for any period during which the Standards of Learning content or assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to statewide administration of such tests, the Board shall provide notice to local school boards regarding such special provisions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall not include in its calculation of the passage rate for a Standards of Learning assessment or the level of achievement of the Standards of Learning objectives for an individual student growth assessment for the purposes of state accountability any student whose parent has decided to not have his child take such Standards of Learning assessment, unless such exclusions would result in the school&#39;s not meeting any required state or federal participation rate.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. The Board may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to &sect; 22.1-19.1 or administrative action pursuant to &sect; 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test security and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of any alleged breach in security, unauthorized alteration, or improper administration of tests, including the exclusion of students from testing who are required to be assessed, by local school board employees responsible for the distribution or administration of the tests.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Records and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the conduct of a review or investigation may be withheld pursuant to subdivision 10 of &sect; 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of records to (i) a local school board or division superintendent for the purpose of permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take personnel action with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion of a review or investigation, in a form that (a) does not reveal the identity of any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a confidential basis and (b) does not compromise the security of any test mandated by the Board. Any local school board or division superintendent receiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel action against a relevant employee, place copies of such records or information relating to the specific employee in such person&#39;s personnel file.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination authorized by this section, including the Standards of Learning assessments, shall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if, in the judgment of the Board, such release would breach the security of such test or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to construct future secure tests.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. With such funds as may be appropriated, the Board may provide, through an agreement with vendors having the technical capacity and expertise to provide computerized tests and assessments, and test construction, analysis, and security, for (i) web-based computerized tests and assessments, including computer-adaptive Standards of Learning assessments, for the evaluation of student progress during and after remediation and (ii) the development of a remediation item bank directly related to the Standards of Learning.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as groups, each local school board shall require the use of Standards of Learning assessments, alternative assessments, and other relevant data, such as industry certification and state licensure examinations, to evaluate student progress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall require the administration of appropriate assessments to students, which may include criterion-referenced tests and teacher-made tests and shall include the Standards of Learning assessments, the local school board&#39;s alternative assessments, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment. Each school board shall provide teachers, parents, principals, and other school leaders with their students&#39; results on any Standards of Learning assessment or Virginia Alternate Assessment Program assessment as soon as practicable after the assessment is administered. Each school board shall analyze and report annually, in compliance with any criteria that may be established by the Board, the results from industry certification examinations and the Standards of Learning assessments to the public.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Board shall include requirements for the reporting of the Standards of Learning assessment data, regardless of accreditation frequency, as part of the Board&#39;s requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such scores shall be disaggregated for each school by student subgroups on the Virginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be reported to the public within three months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the portion of the Department&#39;s website relating to the School Performance Report Card, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year comparisons, and (ii) may include the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-state assessment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. Each local school division superintendent shall regularly review the division&#39;s submission of data and reports required by state and federal law and regulations to ensure that all information is accurate and submitted in a timely fashion. The Superintendent shall provide a list of the required reports and data to division superintendents annually. The status of compliance with this requirement shall be included in the Board&#39;s annual report to the Governor and the General Assembly as required by &sect; 22.1-18.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">H. Any school board may request the Board for release from state regulations or, on behalf of one or more of its schools, for approval of an Individual School Accreditation Plan for the evaluation of the performance of one or more of its schools as authorized for certain other schools by the Standards for Accreditation pursuant to 8VAC20-131-280 C of the Virginia Administrative Code. Waivers of regulatory requirements may be granted by the Board based on submission of a request from the division superintendent and chairman of the local school board. The Board may grant, for a period up to five years, a waiver of regulatory requirements that are not (i) mandated by state or federal law or (ii) designed to promote health or safety.

Outline the conditions necessary for each public institution of higher education to grant course credit for the successful completion of a dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or concurrent enrollment</u> course;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">2. Identify whether each dual enrollment course <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">and each concurrent enrollment course</u> offered in the Commonwealth is transferrable to a public institution of higher education as (i) a Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program or Passport Program course credit, (ii) a general elective course credit, or (iii) a course credit meeting other academic requirements of a public institution of higher education, or if such course is not likely to transfer for course credit. The policy shall also require that each school division and comprehensive community college offering a dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or concurrent enrollment</u> course clearly specify such transfer information on any website, literature, or other materials describing or advertising the course;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">3. Require each public institution of higher education offering a dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or concurrent enrollment</u> course to identify the equivalent non-dual enrollment course <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or non-concurrent enrollment course</u>;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">4. Ensure that the grant of course credit is consistent across each public institution of higher education and each such dual enrollment course <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">and concurrent enrollment course</u>; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">5. Require that the following information be made available on the online portal maintained by the System pursuant to subsection C of &sect; 23.1-908: (i) a description of each dual enrollment course <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">and each concurrent enrollment course</u> offered in the Commonwealth; (ii) the specific academic, career, or technical programs in the System that will accept the course credit and which specific comprehensive community colleges offer such programs; and (iii) if available, the pathway maps in which the dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or concurrent enrollment</u> course is included.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The Council and each public institution of higher education shall make the policy available to the public on their websites. The Council shall also forward the policy to the System for inclusion in the online portal maintained by the System pursuant to &sect; 23.1-908.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The Council shall annually report to the House Committee on Education and the Senate Committee on Education and Health on the implementation of the course credit policy by each public institution of higher education.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>&sect; 23.1-907.

The System, in cooperation with the Council and each public institution of higher education, and consistent with the guidelines developed pursuant to subdivision 20 of &sect; 23.1-203, shall establish a one-semester Passport Program and a one-year Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program. The Passport Program shall consist of 15 course credit hours and shall be a component of the 30-credit-hour Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program. Each Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program and Passport Program course shall be transferable and shall satisfy a lower division general education requirement at any public institution of higher education. The Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program and Passport Program shall be available at each comprehensive community college and through the Online Virginia Network.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. The Council shall establish procedures under which a baccalaureate public institution of higher education may seek a waiver from the Council from accepting the transfer of a Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program or Passport Program course to satisfy the requirements for the completion of a specific pathway or degree. A waiver shall not be granted allowing a baccalaureate public institution to (i) generally reject the transfer of all coursework that is a part of the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program or Passport Program or (ii) generally reject the transfer of a course from the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program or Passport Program for all pathway maps and degrees. An application for a waiver shall identify with particularity the course for which the institution is seeking a waiver and the particular pathway or degree to which the waiver would apply. The application shall provide justification for the waiver and shall designate alternative courses offered through the System that may be completed by a student in order to complete a transferable, 30-credit-hour Uniform Certificate of General Studies or 15-credit-hour Passport. The Council shall adopt guidelines regarding the criteria to be used to review and issue decisions regarding waiver requests. Such waiver requests shall only be granted if the baccalaureate public institution of higher education provides evidence that the specified pathway or degree requires a specialized, lower division course not available through the System. Once approved, notice of a waiver granted by the Council shall be included in the online portal established pursuant to &sect; 23.1-908.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">D. The Council shall develop guidelines for associate-degree-granting and baccalaureate public institutions of higher education to use in mapping pathways for the completion of credits in particular programs of study, including the courses recommended to be taken in a dual enrollment, <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">concurrent enrollment,</u> comprehensive community college, and baccalaureate public institution setting in order to pursue a specific degree or career. Such guidelines shall define the elements of a pathway map and identify the pathway maps to be developed. Initial guidelines adopted for mapping such pathways shall establish a multiyear schedule for the development and implementation of pathway maps for all fields of study.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">E. Each baccalaureate public institution of higher education, in cooperation and consultation with the System, shall develop pathway maps consistent with the guidelines established pursuant to subsection D. Such pathways maps shall clearly set forth the courses that a student at a comprehensive community college is encouraged to complete prior to transferring to the baccalaureate institution. The goal of the career education pathway maps shall be to assist students in achieving optimal efficiencies in the time and cost of completing a degree program. Such program map shall also clearly identify the courses, if any, for which the baccalaureate institution has received a waiver from transfer pursuant to subsection C.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">F. The Council shall prepare a comprehensive annual report on the effectiveness of transferring from comprehensive community colleges to baccalaureate public institutions of higher education, including a review of the effectiveness of the use of pathway maps in achieving efficiencies and cost savings in the completion of a degree program. The report shall include the following elements: completion rates, average time to degree, credit accumulation, post-transfer student academic performance, and comparative efficiency. The Council shall adopt guidelines for data submission from public institutions of higher education necessary for such report, and all institutions shall report such data in accordance with the guidelines. The report shall be made publicly available on the Council website and on the online portal maintained pursuant to &sect; 23.1-908.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">G. Each comprehensive community college shall develop agreements for postsecondary credit and degree attainment with the public high schools in the school divisions that such comprehensive community college serves specifying the options for students to complete an associate degree, the Passport Program, <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">or</strike> the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">, or a high-demand industry-recognized credential</u> concurrent with a high school diploma consistent with <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">the</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">any relevant</u> requirements for the College and Career Ready Virginia Program set forth in Article 5.1 (&sect; 22.1-237.1 et seq.) of Chapter 13 of Title 22.1.

State Transfer Tool.</b>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A. The Council shall develop, in cooperation with the System and each public institution of higher education, a State Transfer Tool that designates each general education course, in addition to the courses that comprise the Uniform Certificate of General Studies Program and the Passport Program, that is offered in an associate degree program at an associate-degree-granting public institution of higher education and transferable for course credit to a baccalaureate public institution of higher education. In developing the State Transfer Tool, the Council shall also seek the participation of private institutions of higher education.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">B. The Council shall develop guidelines to govern the development and implementation of articulation, dual admissions, and guaranteed admissions agreements between associate-degree-granting public institutions of higher education and baccalaureate public institutions of higher education. Dual admissions agreements shall set forth (i) the obligations of each student accepted to such a program, including grade point average requirements, acceptable associate degree majors, and completion timetables, and (ii) the extent to which each student accepted to such a program may access the privileges of enrollment at both institutions while he is enrolled at either institution. Such agreements are subject to the admissions requirements of the baccalaureate public institutions of higher education.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">C. Each baccalaureate public institution of higher education shall update its transfer agreements immediately following any program modifications and shall send a copy of its updated agreement and any other transfer-related documents and resources to the System. The Council shall also send to the System a copy of any transfer-related guidelines and resources that it possesses. The System shall maintain an online portal that allows access to all such agreements, documents, and resources. The online portal shall also include (i) documents and resources related to course equivalency, (ii) pathway maps established pursuant to subsection E of &sect; 23.1-907, (iii) the transfer tool established pursuant to subsection A, (iv) information regarding dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">and concurrent enrollment</u> courses as described in &sect; 23.1-905.1, and (v) any other information required to be included by law or deemed relevant by the System. The online portal shall be available to the public on the websites of the Council, the System, each public institution of higher education, and each school division offering a dual enrollment <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or concurrent enrollment</u> course.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>&sect; 23.1-1002.

The Department shall develop and implement a plan for the annual\ncollection and public reporting of division-level and school-level literacy\ndata, at a time to be determined by the Superintendent, to include results on\nthe literacy screeners provided by the Department and the reading Standards of\nLearning assessments; and\n\n5\\. The Department shall provide free online evidence-based literacy\ninstruction resources that can be accessed by parents and local school boards\nto support student literacy development at home.\n\n**§ 22.1-253.13:3. Standard 3. Accreditation, other standards, assessments,\nand releases from state regulations.**\n\nA. The Board shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for\naccreditation pursuant to the Administrative Process Act (§ 2.2-4000 et seq.),\nwhich shall include (i) student outcome and growth measures, (ii) requirements\nand guidelines for instructional programs and for the integration of\neducational technology into such instructional programs, (iii) administrative\nand instructional staffing levels and positions, including staff positions for\nsupporting educational technology, (iv) student services, (v) auxiliary\neducation programs such as library and media services, (vi) requirements for\ngraduation from high school, (vii) community relations, and (viii) the\nphilosophy, goals, and objectives of public education in the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Board shall promulgate regulations establishing standards for\naccreditation of public virtual schools under the authority of the local\nschool board that enroll students full time.\n\nThe Board's regulations establishing standards for accreditation shall ensure\nthat the accreditation process is transparent and based on objective\nmeasurements and that any appeal of the accreditation status of a school is\nheard and decided by the Board.\n\nThe Board shall review annually the accreditation status of all schools in the\nCommonwealth. The Board shall review the accreditation status of a school once\nevery three years if the school has been fully accredited for three\nconsecutive years. Upon such triennial review, the Board shall review the\naccreditation status of the school for each individual year within that\ntriennial review period. If the Board finds that the school would have been\naccredited every year of that triennial review period the Board shall accredit\nthe school for another three years. The Board may review the accreditation\nstatus of any other school once every two years or once every three years,\nprovided that any school that receives a multiyear accreditation status other\nthan full accreditation shall be covered by a Board-approved multiyear\ncorrective action plan for the duration of the period of accreditation. Such\nmultiyear corrective action plan shall include annual written progress updates\nto the Board. A multiyear accreditation status shall not relieve any school or\ndivision of annual reporting requirements.\n\nEach local school board shall maintain schools that are fully accredited\npursuant to the standards for accreditation as prescribed by the Board. Each\nlocal school board shall report the accreditation status of all schools in the\nlocal school division annually in public session.\n\nThe Board shall establish a review process to assist any school that does not\nmeet the standards established by the Board. The relevant school board shall\nreport the results of such review and any annual progress reports in public\nsession and shall implement any actions identified through such review and\nutilize them for improvement planning.\n\nThe Board shall establish a corrective action plan process for any school that\ndoes not meet the standards established by the Board. Such process shall\nrequire (a) each school board to submit a corrective action plan for any\nschool in the local school division that does not meet the standards\nestablished by the Board and (b) any school board that fails to demonstrate\nprogress in developing or implementing any such corrective action plan to\nenter into a memorandum of understanding with the Board.\n\nWhen the Board determines through its review process that the failure of\nschools within a division to meet the standards established by the Board is\nrelated to division-level failure to implement the Standards of Quality or\nother division-level action or inaction, the Board may require a division-\nlevel academic review. After the conduct of such review and within the time\nspecified by the Board, each school board shall enter into a memorandum of\nunderstanding with the Board and shall subsequently submit to the Board for\napproval a corrective action plan, consistent with criteria established by the\nBoard setting forth specific actions and a schedule designed to ensure that\nschools within its school division meet the standards established by the\nBoard. If the Board determines that the proposed corrective action plan is not\nsufficient to enable all schools within the division to meet the standards\nestablished by the Board, the Board may return the plan to the local school\nboard with directions to submit an amended plan pursuant to Board guidance.\nSuch corrective action plans shall be part of the relevant school division's\ncomprehensive plan pursuant to § 22.1-253.13:6.\n\nB. The Superintendent shall develop, subject to revision by the Board,\ncriteria for determining and recognizing educational performance in the\nCommonwealth's local school divisions and public schools. The portion of such\ncriteria that measures individual student growth shall become an integral part\nof the accreditation process for schools in which any grade level in the grade\nthree through eight range is taught. The Superintendent shall annually report\nto the Board on the accreditation status of all school divisions and schools.\nSuch report shall include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of\npublic education programs in the various school divisions in Virginia and\nrecommendations to the General Assembly for further enhancing student learning\nuniformly across the Commonwealth. In recognizing educational performance and\nindividual student growth in the school divisions, the Board shall include\nconsideration of special school division accomplishments, such as numbers of\ndual enrollments _and concurrent enrollments_ and students in Advanced\nPlacement and International Baccalaureate courses, and participation in\nacademic year Governor's Schools.\n\nThe Superintendent shall assist local school boards in the implementation of\naction plans for increasing educational performance and individual student\ngrowth in those school divisions and schools that are identified as not\nmeeting the approved criteria. The Superintendent shall monitor the\nimplementation of and report to the Board on the effectiveness of the\ncorrective actions taken to improve the educational performance in such school\ndivisions and schools.\n\nC. With such funds as are available for this purpose, the Board shall\nprescribe assessment methods to determine the level of achievement of the\nStandards of Learning objectives by all students. Such assessments shall\nevaluate knowledge, application of knowledge, critical thinking, and skills\nrelated to the Standards of Learning being assessed. The Board shall, with the\nassistance of independent testing experts, conduct a regular analysis and\nvalidation process for these assessments. In lieu of a one-time end-of-year\nassessment, the Board shall establish, for the purpose of providing measures\nof individual student growth over the course of the school year, a through-\nyear growth assessment system, aligned with the Standards of Learning, for the\nadministration of reading and mathematics assessments in grades three through\neight. Such through-year growth assessment system shall include at least one\nbeginning-of-year, one mid-year, and one end-of-year assessment in order to\nprovide individual student growth scores over the course of the school year,\nbut the total time scheduled for taking all such assessments shall not exceed\n150 percent of the time scheduled for taking a single end-of-year proficiency\nassessment. The Department shall ensure adequate training for teachers and\nprincipals on how to interpret and use student growth data from such\nassessments to improve reading and mathematics instruction in grades three\nthrough eight throughout the school year. With such funds and content as are\navailable for such purpose, such through-year growth assessment system shall\nprovide accurate measurement of a student's performance, through computer\nadaptive technology, using test items at, below, and above the student's grade\nlevel as necessary.\n\nThe Board shall also provide the option of industry certification and state\nlicensure examinations as a student-selected credit.\n\nThe Department shall make available to school divisions Standards of Learning\nassessments typically administered by high schools by December 1 of the school\nyear in which such assessments are to be administered or when newly developed\nassessments are available, whichever is later.\n\nThe Board shall make publicly available such assessments in a timely manner\nand as soon as practicable following the administration of such tests, so long\nas the release of such assessments does not compromise test security or\ndeplete the bank of assessment questions necessary to construct subsequent\ntests, or limit the ability to test students on demand and provide immediate\nresults in the web-based assessment system.\n\nThe Board shall prescribe alternative methods of Standards of Learning\nassessment administration for children with disabilities, as that term is\ndefined in § 22.1-213, who meet criteria established by the Board to\ndemonstrate achievement of the Standards of Learning. An eligible student's\nIndividual Education Program team shall make the final determination as to\nwhether an alternative method of administration is appropriate for the\nstudent.\n\nThe Board shall include in the student outcome and growth measures that are\nrequired by the standards of accreditation the required assessments for\nvarious grade levels and classes, including the completion of the alternative\nassessments implemented by each local school board, in accordance with the\nStandards of Learning. These assessments shall include end-of-course or end-\nof-grade tests for English, mathematics, science, and history and social\nscience and may be integrated to include multiple subject areas.\n\nThe Standards of Learning assessments administered to students in grades three\nthrough eight shall not exceed (i) reading and mathematics in grades three and\nfour; (ii) reading, mathematics, and science in grade five; (iii) reading and\nmathematics in grades six and seven; (iv) reading, writing, and mathematics in\ngrade eight; (v) science after the student receives instruction in the grade\nsix science, life science, and physical science Standards of Learning and\nbefore the student completes grade eight; and (vi) Virginia Studies and Civics\nand Economics once each at the grade levels deemed appropriate by each local\nschool board. The reading and mathematics assessments administered to students\nin grades three through eight shall be through-year growth assessments.\n\nEach school board shall annually certify that it has provided instruction and\nadministered an alternative assessment, consistent with Board guidelines, to\nstudents in grades three through eight in each Standards of Learning subject\narea in which a Standards of Learning assessment was not administered during\nthe school year. Such guidelines shall (a) incorporate options for age-\nappropriate, authentic performance assessments and portfolios with rubrics and\nother methodologies designed to ensure that students are making adequate\nacademic progress in the subject area and that the Standards of Learning\ncontent is being taught; (b) permit and encourage integrated assessments that\ninclude multiple subject areas; and (c) emphasize collaboration between\nteachers to administer and substantiate the assessments and the professional\ndevelopment of teachers to enable them to make the best use of alternative\nassessments.\n\nLocal school divisions shall provide targeted mathematics remediation and\nintervention to students in grades six through eight who show computational\ndeficiencies as demonstrated by their individual performance on any diagnostic\ntest or grade-level Standards of Learning mathematics test that measures non-\ncalculator computational skills.\n\nThe Department shall award recovery credit to any student in grades three\nthrough eight who performs below grade level on a Standards of Learning\nassessment in English reading or mathematics, receives remediation, and\nsubsequently retakes and performs at or above grade level on such an\nassessment, including any such student who subsequently retakes such an\nassessment on an expedited basis.\n\nIn addition, to assess the educational progress of students, the Board shall\n(1) develop appropriate assessments, which may include criterion-referenced\ntests and other assessment instruments that may be used by classroom teachers;\n(2) select appropriate industry certification and state licensure\nexaminations; and (3) prescribe and provide measures, which may include\nnationally normed tests to be used to identify students who score in the\nbottom quartile at selected grade levels.\n\nThe Standards of Learning requirements, including all related assessments,\nshall be waived for any student awarded a scholarship under the Brown v. Board\nof Education Scholarship Program, pursuant to § 30-231.2, who is enrolled in a\npreparation program for a high school equivalency examination approved by the\nBoard or in an adult basic education program or an adult secondary education\nprogram to obtain the high school diploma or a high school equivalency\ncertificate.\n\nThe Department shall develop processes for informing school divisions of\nchanges in the Standards of Learning.\n\nThe Board may adopt special provisions related to the administration and use\nof any Standards of Learning test or tests in a content area as applied to\naccreditation ratings for any period during which the Standards of Learning\ncontent or assessments in that area are being revised and phased in. Prior to\nstatewide administration of such tests, the Board shall provide notice to\nlocal school boards regarding such special provisions.\n\nThe Board shall not include in its calculation of the passage rate for a\nStandards of Learning assessment or the level of achievement of the Standards\nof Learning objectives for an individual student growth assessment for the\npurposes of state accountability any student whose parent has decided to not\nhave his child take such Standards of Learning assessment, unless such\nexclusions would result in the school's not meeting any required state or\nfederal participation rate.\n\nD. The Board may pursue all available civil remedies pursuant to § 22.1-19.1\nor administrative action pursuant to § 22.1-292.1 for breaches in test\nsecurity and unauthorized alteration of test materials or test results.\n\nThe Board may initiate or cause to be initiated a review or investigation of\nany alleged breach in security, unauthorized alteration, or improper\nadministration of tests, including the exclusion of students from testing who\nare required to be assessed, by local school board employees responsible for\nthe distribution or administration of the tests.\n\nRecords and other information furnished to or prepared by the Board during the\nconduct of a review or investigation may be withheld pursuant to subdivision\n10 of § 2.2-3705.3. However, this section shall not prohibit the disclosure of\nrecords to (i) a local school board or division superintendent for the purpose\nof permitting such board or superintendent to consider or to take personnel\naction with regard to an employee or (ii) any requester, after the conclusion\nof a review or investigation, in a form that (a) does not reveal the identity\nof any person making a complaint or supplying information to the Board on a\nconfidential basis and (b) does not compromise the security of any test\nmandated by the Board. Any local school board or division superintendent\nreceiving such records or other information shall, upon taking personnel\naction against a relevant employee, place copies of such records or\ninformation relating to the specific employee in such person's personnel file.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of state law, no test or examination\nauthorized by this section, including the Standards of Learning assessments,\nshall be released or required to be released as minimum competency tests, if,\nin the judgment of the Board, such release would breach the security of such\ntest or examination or deplete the bank of questions necessary to construct\nfuture secure tests.\n\nE. With such funds as may be appropriated, the Board may provide, through an\nagreement with vendors having the technical capacity and expertise to provide\ncomputerized tests and assessments, and test construction, analysis, and\nsecurity, for (i) web-based computerized tests and assessments, including\ncomputer-adaptive Standards of Learning assessments, for the evaluation of\nstudent progress during and after remediation and (ii) the development of a\nremediation item bank directly related to the Standards of Learning.\n\nF. To assess the educational progress of students as individuals and as\ngroups, each local school board shall require the use of Standards of Learning\nassessments, alternative assessments, and other relevant data, such as\nindustry certification and state licensure examinations, to evaluate student\nprogress and to determine educational performance. Each local school shall\nrequire the administration of appropriate assessments to students, which may\ninclude criterion-referenced tests and teacher-made tests and shall include\nthe Standards of Learning assessments, the local school board's alternative\nassessments, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-\nstate assessment. Each school board shall provide teachers, parents,\nprincipals, and other school leaders with their students' results on any\nStandards of Learning assessment or Virginia Alternate Assessment Program\nassessment as soon as practicable after the assessment is administered. Each\nschool board shall analyze and report annually, in compliance with any\ncriteria that may be established by the Board, the results from industry\ncertification examinations and the Standards of Learning assessments to the\npublic.\n\nThe Board shall include requirements for the reporting of the Standards of\nLearning assessment data, regardless of accreditation frequency, as part of\nthe Board's requirements relating to the School Performance Report Card. Such\nscores shall be disaggregated for each school by student subgroups on the\nVirginia assessment program as appropriate and shall be reported to the public\nwithin three months of their receipt. These reports (i) shall be posted on the\nportion of the Department's website relating to the School Performance Report\nCard, in a format and in a manner that allows year-to-year comparisons, and\n(ii) may include the National Assessment of Educational Progress state-by-\nstate assessment.\n\nG. Each local school division superintendent shall regularly review the\ndivision's submission of data and reports required by state and federal law\nand regulations to ensure that all information is accurate and submitted in a\ntimely fashion. The Superintendent shall provide a list of the required\nreports and data to division superintendents annually. The status of\ncompliance with this requirement shall be included in the Board's annual\nreport to the Governor and the General Assembly as required by § 22.1-18.\n\nH. Any school board may request the Board for release from state regulations\nor, on behalf of one or more of its schools, for approval of an Individual\nSchool Accreditation Plan for the evaluation of the performance of one or more\nof its schools as authorized for certain other schools by the Standards for\nAccreditation pursuant to 8VAC20-131-280 C of the Virginia Administrative\nCode. Waivers of regulatory requirements may be granted by the Board based on\nsubmission of a request from the division superintendent and chairman of the\nlocal school board. The Board may grant, for a period up to five years, a\nwaiver of regulatory requirements that are not (i) mandated by state or\nfederal law or (ii) designed to promote health or safety. The school board\nshall provide in its waiver request a description of how the releases from\nstate regulations are designed to increase the quality of instruction and\nimprove the achievement of students in the affected school or schools. The\nDepartment shall provide (a) guidance to any local school division that\nrequests releases from state regulations and (b) information about\nopportunities to form partnerships with other agencies or entities to any\nlocal school division in which the school or schools granted releases from\nstate regulations have demonstrated improvement in the quality of instruction\nand the achievement of students.\n\nThe Board may also grant local school boards waivers of specific requirements\nin § 22.1-253.13:2, based on submission of a request from the division\nsuperintendent and chairman of the local school board, permitting the local\nschool board to assign instructional personnel to the schools with the\ngreatest needs, so long as the school division employs a sufficient number of\npersonnel divisionwide to meet the total number required by § 22.1-253.13:2\nand all pupil/teacher ratios and class size maximums set forth in subsection C\nof § 22.1-253.13:2 are met. The school board shall provide in its request a\ndescription of how the waivers from specific Standards of Quality staffing\nstandards are designed to increase the quality of instruction and improve the\nachievement of students in the affected school or schools.

Such pathways maps shall\nclearly set forth the courses that a student at a comprehensive community\ncollege is encouraged to complete prior to transferring to the baccalaureate\ninstitution. The goal of the career education pathway maps shall be to assist\nstudents in achieving optimal efficiencies in the time and cost of completing\na degree program. Such program map shall also clearly identify the courses, if\nany, for which the baccalaureate institution has received a waiver from\ntransfer pursuant to subsection C.\n\nF. The Council shall prepare a comprehensive annual report on the\neffectiveness of transferring from comprehensive community colleges to\nbaccalaureate public institutions of higher education, including a review of\nthe effectiveness of the use of pathway maps in achieving efficiencies and\ncost savings in the completion of a degree program. The report shall include\nthe following elements: completion rates, average time to degree, credit\naccumulation, post-transfer student academic performance, and comparative\nefficiency.
