The advisory council shall assess views of the health provider community relative to insurance rates of reimbursement, billing, and reimbursement procedures, and the insurers&#39; role in promoting efficient and high-quality health care. The advisory council shall issue an annual report of findings and recommendations to the governor and the general assembly and present its findings at hearings before the house and senate finance committees.
