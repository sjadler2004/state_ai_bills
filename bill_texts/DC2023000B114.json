Findings and declaration of policy. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Council of the District of Columbia makes the following findings: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(a) It is the sense of the Council that technological advancements should support the dignity and well-being of the people of the District. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) Computers and data-derived decision-making tools play ever larger roles in modern life. As of 2019, 90 percent of U.S. adults regularly used the internet. Approximately 76 percent of households in the District of Columbia have a broadband internet subscription, and many who lack a home internet connection use smartphones to go online. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(c) When District residents engage in online activities like posting on social media, searching web-based listings for an apartment, or submitting electronic job applications, they generate personalized information that is harvested by data collectors. Data collectors can track hundreds of categories of data about specific individuals including age, gender, employment status and place of employment, income level, sexual orientation, national origin, and religion. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(d) Companies often use data from both online and offline sources to create algorithms, which are tools that use machine learning and personal data to make educated guesses about an individual&rsquo;s preferences, abilities, and future behavior. These algorithms are then incorporated into decision-making processes that affect many aspects of life. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(e) Increasingly, algorithms determine an individual&rsquo;s opportunities to secure employment, insurance, credit, housing, and public accommodations, as well as access to information about those opportunities. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(f) Algorithms often rely on personal traits protected under the D.C. Human Rights Act. And algorithmic decision-making can amplify discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, source of income, credit information, and other protected traits when algorithmic models replicate existing societal inequalities. Algorithmic decision-making systems that fail to account for bias disproportionately harm marginalized communities. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) Despite their prevalence and the potential problems they pose, algorithms are poorly understood by most individuals, in part because of the many entities involved and the lack of accountability among those entities. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) This act seeks to protect individuals and classes of individuals from the harm that results when algorithmic decision-making processes operate without transparency, rely on protected traits and other personal data that are correlated with those traits, or disproportionately limit access to and information about important life opportunities. The act combats these challenges by: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) Encouraging transparency and accountability by requiring covered entities to provide notice to individuals about how the covered entity uses personal information in algorithmic decisions, including additional information when the algorithmic decision results in an adverse action, audit its algorithmic determination practices for discriminatory processing or impact, and report this information to the Office of the Attorney General; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) Prohibiting adverse algorithmic decision-making based on protected traits, or that have the effect of making decisions based on such traits; and </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) Creating public investigatory and enforcement authority, and an individual right of action. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Sec. 3. Definitions. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The following words and terms when used in this act have the following meanings: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) &ldquo;Adverse action&rdquo; means a denial, cancellation, or other adverse change or assessment regarding an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for, opportunity to access, or terms of access to important life opportunities. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(2) &ldquo;Algorithmic eligibility determination&rdquo; means a determination based in whole or in significant part on an algorithmic process that utilizes machine learning, artificial intelligence, or similar techniques to determine an individual&rsquo;s eligibility for, or opportunity to access, important life opportunities. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(3) &ldquo;Algorithmic information availability determination&rdquo; means a determination based in whole or in significant part on an algorithmic process that utilizes machine learning, artificial intelligence, or similar techniques to determine an individual&rsquo;s receipt of advertising, marketing, solicitations, or offers for an important life opportunity. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(4) &ldquo;Covered entity&rdquo; means any individual, firm, corporation, partnership, cooperative, association, or any other organization, legal entity, or group of individuals however organized, including entities related by common ownership or corporate control, that either makes algorithmic eligibility determinations or algorithmic information availability determinations, or relies on algorithmic eligibility determinations or algorithmic information availability determinations supplied by a service provider, and that meets one of the following criteria: </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(A) Possesses or controls personal information on more than 25,000 District residents; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(B) Has greater than $15 million in average annualized gross receipts for the 3 years preceding the most recent fiscal year; </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(C) Is a data broker, or other entity, that derives 50 percent or more of its annual revenue by collecting, assembling, selling, distributing, providing access to, or maintaining personal information, and some proportion of the personal information concerns a District resident who is not a customer or an employee of that entity; or </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(D) Is a service provider. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(5) &ldquo;Important life opportunities&rdquo; means access to, approval for, or offer of credit, education, employment, housing, a place of public accommodation as defined in section 102(24) of the Human Rights Act of 1977, effective December 13, 1977 (D.C.

These algorithms are then incorporated into decision-making\nprocesses that affect many aspects of life.\n\n(e) Increasingly, algorithms determine an individual's opportunities to secure\nemployment, insurance, credit, housing, and public accommodations, as well as\naccess to information about those opportunities.\n\n(f) Algorithms often rely on personal traits protected under the D.C. Human\nRights Act. And algorithmic decision-making can amplify discrimination based\non race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age, source of income, credit\ninformation, and other protected traits when algorithmic models replicate\nexisting societal inequalities. Algorithmic decision-making systems that fail\nto account for bias disproportionately harm marginalized communities.\n\n(g) Despite their prevalence and the potential problems they pose, algorithms\nare poorly understood by most individuals, in part because of the many\nentities involved and the lack of accountability among those entities.\n\n(h) This act seeks to protect individuals and classes of individuals from the\nharm that results when algorithmic decision-making processes operate without\ntransparency, rely on protected traits and other personal data that are\ncorrelated with those traits, or disproportionately limit access to and\ninformation about important life opportunities. The act combats these\nchallenges by:\n\n(1) Encouraging transparency and accountability by requiring covered entities\nto provide notice to individuals about how the covered entity uses personal\ninformation in algorithmic decisions, including additional information when\nthe algorithmic decision results in an adverse action, audit its algorithmic\ndetermination practices for discriminatory processing or impact, and report\nthis information to the Office of the Attorney General;\n\n(2) Prohibiting adverse algorithmic decision-making based on protected traits,\nor that have the effect of making decisions based on such traits; and\n\n(3) Creating public investigatory and enforcement authority, and an individual\nright of action.\n\nSec. 3.
