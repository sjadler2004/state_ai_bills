In preparing the &quot;Best Practices Inventory,&quot; the director shall identify best municipal practices in the areas of general administration, fiscal management, and operational activities, as well as the particular circumstances of a municipality, in determining the minimum score acceptable for the release of the total annual amount due for the current fiscal year.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The Director of the Division of Local Government Services may permit any municipality that received &quot;Regional Efficiency Aid Program&quot; funds pursuant to the annual appropriations act for fiscal year 2010, P.L.2009, c.68, to use a portion of its Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid or Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid, or both Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid and Energy Tax Receipts Property Tax Relief Aid, to provide &quot;Regional Efficiency Aid Program&quot; benefits pursuant to P.L.1999, c.61 (C.54: 4-8.76 et seq.).</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Trenton Capital City Aid is subject to the following condition: The City of Trenton shall enter into an agreement with the Department of Community Affairs setting forth the terms and conditions for receipt of such aid, which shall include financial and operational oversight by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Consolidation Implementation shall be allocated to provide reimbursement to local government units that consolidate pursuant to any law, including but not limited to P.L.2007, c.63 (C.40A: 65-1 et seq.) and P.L.2009, c.118 (C.54: 1-86 et seq.), or to a municipality that is wholly annexed by another municipality pursuant to N.J.S.40A: 7-1 et seq., for non-recurring costs that the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, or in the case of a school district consolidation the Commissioner of Education, determines to be necessary to implement such consolidation or annexation, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting; provided, however, that in addition to the amounts hereinabove appropriated, there are appropriated such additional amounts as are determined to be necessary for reimbursement of non-recurring costs associated with local government unit consolidations, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting; provided further that there are appropriated such additional amounts, not to exceed $15,000,000, as the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs and the Director of the Division of Local Government Services, shall determine to be necessary to design and implement one or more voluntary county-based demonstration projects to achieve efficiencies and future cost savings in the provision of services at the local level.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Of the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities, an amount may be allocated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to provide short-term financial assistance to a local government unit that is determined by the director to be experiencing financial distress caused by the destruction or loss of a major local business ratable. For purposes of this paragraph, a &quot;major local business ratable&quot; means one or more related parcels of property owned by a single business entity, classified as commercial or industrial, which comprised the largest assessed valuation of any one or more line items of taxable property in a municipality, or generated an annual PILOT payment in excess of 10% of the total municipal levy, or is otherwise determined by the director to be of such significance to a municipality that its destruction or loss has resulted in financial distress; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the Director of the Division of Local Government Services may direct that part of any such allocation be paid to an affected school district or county, or to both, in the same manner as if the award of Transitional Aid were raised as revenue from the municipal tax levy; and provided further that a local government unit determined to be experiencing financial distress because of the loss or destruction of a major local business ratable shall not be required to be subject to any additional conditions, requirements, orders, or other operational efficiency or oversight measures authorized pursuant to P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52: 27D-118.42a), except as determined to be appropriate by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Of the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities, amounts may be allocated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services to any State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority to pay for services provided to or on behalf of a participating municipal government unit pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between that State agency or department, county, or county improvement authority, as applicable and the Division of Local Government Services, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities is subject to the following condition: notwithstanding the provisions of R.S.43: 21-14, or any other law or regulation to the contrary, the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is authorized to enter into individualized payment plan agreements with municipalities that receive Transitional Aid for the reimbursement of unemployment benefits paid to former employees of such municipal government units, at reasonable interest rates based on current market conditions, and on such other terms and conditions as may be determined to be appropriate by the Commissioner of Labor and Workforce Development. Any municipality that enters into an individualized payment plan agreement pursuant to this section shall be required to expend all funds budgeted for this activity remaining as of the last day of its budget year for the repayment of outstanding obligations under the plan.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities shall be allocated to provide short-term financial assistance where needed to help a municipality that is in serious fiscal distress meet immediate budgetary needs and regain financial stability. A municipality shall be deemed to be eligible for transitional aid if it is identified by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services as experiencing serious fiscal distress where the director determines that, despite local officials having implemented substantive cost reduction strategies, there continue to exist conditions of serious fiscal distress, which may include but shall not be limited to: substantial structural or accumulated deficits; ongoing reliance on non-recurring revenues; limited ability to raise supplemental non-property tax revenues; extraordinary demands for public safety appropriations; and other factors indicating a constrained ability to raise sufficient revenues to meet budgetary requirements that substantially jeopardizes the fiscal integrity of the municipality. Municipalities seeking transitional aid shall file an application on a form prescribed by the director, which application, among other things, shall set forth the minimum criteria that must be met in order for an application to be considered by the director for a determination of eligibility. The director shall determine whether a municipality which files an application meeting such minimum criteria is in serious fiscal distress, and, if so, what amount of transitional aid should be provided to address the municipality&#39;s serious fiscal distress. The transitional aid shall be provided to the municipality subject to the provisions of subsection a. of section 1 of P.L.2011, c.144 (C.52: 27D-118.42a); provided, however, that an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities as determined by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services for a municipality may be deemed to constitute Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid in an amount not in excess of the amount of Transitional Aid to Localities such municipality received in the previous fiscal year and shall not reduce the amount of Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid such municipality shall receive for the current fiscal year. Provided, however, if the Director of the Division of Local Government Services deems an amount of Transitional Aid to Localities for a municipality as constituting Consolidated Municipal Property Tax Relief Aid pursuant to this provision, that municipality is not relieved from compliance with the requirements for transitional aid.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection d. of section 29 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13: 8C-29) or subsection d. of section 30 of P.L.1999, c.152 (C.13: 8C-30), or any law or regulation to the contrary, all payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be retained by the municipality and not apportioned in the same manner as the general tax rate of the municipality.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, payments to municipalities in lieu of taxes for lands acquired by the State and non-profit organizations for recreation and conservation purposes shall be provided only to the municipalities whose payments received in fiscal year 2010 exceeded $5,000 and shall be provided at the payment amount provided in fiscal year 2024, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, any qualifying municipality, as defined in section 1 of P.L.1978, c.14 (C.52: 27D-178) for the previous fiscal year, shall continue to be a qualifying municipality thereunder during the current fiscal year.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, whenever funds appropriated as State Aid and payable to any municipality, which municipality requests and receives the approval of the Local Finance Board, such funds may be pledged as a guarantee for payment of principal and interest on any bond anticipation notes issued pursuant to section 11 of P.L.2003, c.15 (C.40A: 2-8.1) and any tax anticipation notes issued pursuant to N.J.S.40A: 4-64 by such municipality. Such funds, if so pledged, shall be made available by the State Treasurer upon receipt of a written notification by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services that the municipality does not have sufficient funds available for prompt payment of principal and interest on such notes, and shall be paid by the State Treasurer directly to the holders of such notes at such time and in such amounts as specified by the director, notwithstanding that payment of such funds does not coincide with any date for payment otherwise fixed by law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The State Treasurer, in consultation with the Commissioner of Community Affairs, is empowered to direct the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting to transfer appropriations from any State department to any other State department as may be necessary to provide a loan for a term not to exceed 180 days to a local government unit faced with a fiscal crisis, including but not limited to a potential default on tax anticipation notes and on such other terms and conditions as may be required by the commissioner.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.40A: 4-39 or any other law or regulation to the contrary, a county that assumes responsibility for the provision of local police services in one or more municipalities utilizing a new or expanded county police force may display the anticipated revenues and appropriations associated with such county police force in its annual budget by annexing to that budget a statement describing the sources and amounts of anticipated dedicated revenues and appropriating those dedicated amounts for the purposes of the county police force.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The amount hereinabove appropriated for Bloomfield, Belleville,

Any hospital that meets more than one of the categories pursuant to this paragraph shall only receive a Charity Care subsidy equal to the percentage of documented charity care that is the highest.

In the event the hospital completed a merger, acquisition, or business combination resulting in two cost reports filed during the calendar year, two cost reports will be combined into one or a supplemental cost report for the calendar year 2022 submitted by the affected acute care hospital by January 31, 2021 shall be used. In the event that a hospital did not report its Medicaid managed care days on the cost report utilized in this calculation, the Department of Health (DOH) shall ascertain Medicaid managed care encounter days for Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare clients as reported by insurers to the State as per source data defined in (b) above; (d) Medicaid managed care DME cost begins with the intern and residency program costs using the 2022 submitted Medicaid cost report total residency costs, reported on Worksheet B Pt I Column 21 Line 21 plus Worksheet B Pt I Column 22 Line 22 divided by the 2022 resident full time equivalent employees (FTE), reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 line 14 to develop an average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (e) median cost per resident FTE is calculated based on the average cost per resident FTE for each hospital; (f) the median cost per resident FTE is multiplied by the 2022 resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 to develop total median residency program cost for each hospital; (g) median residency costs are multiplied by the ratio of Medicaid managed care days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 7 Line 2, divided by the difference of total days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 14, less nursery days, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 8 Line 13 to determine the Medicaid managed care DME cost of each hospital; (h) Medicaid managed care IME cost is defined as the Medicare IME factor multiplied by Medicaid managed care encounter payments as per source data defined in (b) above; (i) the IME factor is calculated using the Medicare IME formula as follows: 1.35 * ((1 + x) 0.405 - 1), in which &quot;x&quot; is the ratio of submitted IME resident FTEs reported on Worksheet S-3 Pt 1 Column 9 Line 14 divided by the difference of total available beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 14, less nursery beds, reported on Worksheet S-3 Column 2 Line 13; (j) total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs shall equal total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs plus total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs; (k) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care DME costs is divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (l) the DME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (k) above; (m) each hospital&#39;s percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care DME costs shall be multiplied by the DME allocation to calculate its DME payment; (n) the 2022 total Medicaid managed care IME costs are divided by the total 2022 Medicaid managed care GME costs; (o) the IME allocation portion is calculated by multiplying the total subsidy amount by the ratio in (n) above; (p) each hospital&#39;s percentage of total 2022 Medicaid managed care IME costs shall be multiplied by the IME allocation to calculate its IME payment; (q) the sum of a hospital&#39;s DME and IME payments shall equal its subsidy payment.

For legend drugs purchased through the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the maximum allowable cost shall be based on the 340B ceiling price. In the absence of a 340B ceiling price, the alternative benchmark used shall be the WAC minus a volume discount of 25 percent. The 340B ceiling price or the alternative benchmark shall only apply when its price is the lowest compared to the pricing formulas described by (i) through (v) above. Reimbursement for covered outpatient drugs shall be calculated based on: (i) the lower of the AAC plus a professional fee of $10.92; or a provider&#39;s usual and customary charge; or (ii) the lower of cost acquisition data submitted by providers of pharmaceutical services for brand-name multi-source and multi-source drugs, where an alternative pricing benchmark is not available, plus a professional fee of $10.92; or a provider&#39;s usual and customary charge. To effectuate the calculation of SUL rates and/or the calculation of single-source and brand-name multi-source legend and non-legend drug costs where an alternative pricing benchmark is not available, the Department of Human Services shall mandate ongoing submission of current drug acquisition data by providers of pharmaceutical services.

The amount provided herein shall be allocated to the private motorbus carriers consistent with the formula used to administer the PCCIP and shall be restricted to those carriers that currently qualify for participation in the PCCIP. These funds may be used for the procurement of any goods or services currently approved under New Jersey Transit Corporation&#39;s PCCIP, as well as: facility improvements, vehicle procurement, and capital maintenance that comports with section 3 of P.L.1984, c.73 (C.27: 1B-3). Such maintenance and equipment procurements shall apply to vehicles owned by the private motorbus carriers and used in public transportation service, as well as to New Jersey Transit Corporation-owned vehicles. Private motorbus carriers receiving an allocation of such funds shall be required to submit to the New Jersey Transit Corporation a full accounting for all expenditures, demonstrating that the funds were used to increase or maintain the current level of public transportation service provided by the carrier or to improve revenue vehicle maintenance. Under no circumstances shall these funds be used to provide compensation of any officer or owner of a private motorbus carrier.</p>\n   <p class=\"center\">\n    <i>\n     <b>64 Regulation and General Management</b>\n    </i>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"center\">\n    <b>\n     <u>DIRECT STATE SERVICES</u>\n    </b>\n   </p>\n   <table>\n    <tr>\n     <td>05-6070 </td>\n     <td>Multimodal Services </td>\n     <td>$801,000 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>99-6000 </td>\n     <td>Administration and Support Services </td>\n     <td>$735,000 </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td></td>\n     <td>Total Direct State Services Appropriation, Regulation and General Management </td>\n     <td>$1,536,000 </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <b>\n     <i>Direct State Services: </i>\n    </b>\n   </p>\n   <table>\n    <tr>\n     <td></td>\n     <td>Materials and Supplies </td>\n     <td>($105,000) </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td></td>\n     <td>Services Other Than Personal </td>\n     <td>($713,000) </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td></td>\n     <td>Maintenance and Fixed Charges </td>\n     <td>($5,000) </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td></td>\n     <td>Special Purpose: </td>\n     <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>05 </td>\n     <td>Office of Maritime Resources </td>\n     <td>($248,000) </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n     <td>05 </td>\n     <td>Airport Safety Administration </td>\n     <td>($465,000) </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Receipts in excess of the amount anticipated from outdoor advertising application and permit fees are appropriated for the purpose of administering the Outdoor Advertising Permit and Regulation Program, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Receipts from fees on placarded rail freight cars transporting hazardous materials in this state are appropriated to defray the expenses of the Placarded Rail Freight Car Transporting Hazardous Materials Program, subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of Budget and Accounting.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The unexpended balance at the end of the preceding fiscal year in the Airport Safety Fund account together with any receipts in excess of the amount anticipated are appropriated for the same purpose.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the provisions of any law or regulation to the contrary, the amount hereinabove appropriated for Airport Safety Administration is payable out of the Airport Safety Fund established pursuant to section 4 of P.L.1983, c.264 (C.6: 1-92).
