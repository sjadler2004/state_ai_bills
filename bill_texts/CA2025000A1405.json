The bill would require an AI auditor that enrolls with the agency to pay an enrollment fee, to be fixed by the agency by January 1, 2027, and provide specified information. The bill would impose various requirements on an AI auditor that conducts a covered audit, including, among other things, providing the auditee with an audit report after the covered audit.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would prohibit the AI auditor from accepting employment with an auditee within 12 months of completing a covered audit of the auditee, disclosing confidential information except under certain circumstances, and preventing an employee from engaging in, or retaliating against an employee who has engaged in, specified whistleblower activity.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would create the AI Auditors&#39; Enrollment Fund within the State Treasury, to be administered by the agency, and would require that all moneys collected or received by the agency pursuant to the above-described provisions be deposited into the fund to be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to administer the above-described provisions.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: NO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.
