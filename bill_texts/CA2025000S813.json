This approach creates an adaptable and predictable compliance mechanism that ensures AI governance standards can evolve quickly alongside technological advancements.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">(e) Legal safeguards are effective means to incentivize responsible AI development and prevent unnecessary harm.

An MRO surpasses traditional regulation by incentivizing a race to the top for transparency and safety that prioritizes innovation and adaptability and serves as a central, informed voice to governments and society for responsive, forward-looking governance.</u>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">SEC. 2.

The\nCalifornia AI Transparency Act requires a covered provider, as defined, of a\ngenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) system to offer the user the option\nto include a manifest disclosure in image, video, or audio content, or content\nthat is any combination thereof, created or altered by the covered provider 's\nGenAI system that, among other things, identifies content as AI-generated\ncontent._\n\n_This bill would establish a process by which the Attorney General designates,\nfor a renewable period of 3 years, a private entity as a multistakeholder\nregulatory organization (MRO) if that entity meets certain requirements,\nincluding that the entity presents a plan that ensures acceptable mitigation\nof risk from any MRO-certified artificial intelligence models and artificial\nintelligence applications. The bill would require an applicant for designation\nby the Attorney General as an MRO to submit with its application a plan that\ncontains certain elements, including the applicant 's approach to mitigating\nspecific high-impact risks, including cybersecurity, chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear threats, malign persuasion, and artificial\nintelligence model autonomy and exfiltration._\n\n_This bill would require an MRO to perform various responsibilities related to\ncertifying the safety of artificial intelligence models and artificial\nintelligence applications, including decertifying an artificial intelligence\nmodel or artificial intelligence application that does not meet the\nrequirements prescribed by the MRO and submitting an annual report to the\nLegislature and the Attorney General that addresses, among other things, the\nadequacy of existing evaluation resources and mitigation measures to mitigate\nobserved and potential risks._\n\n_This bill would provide that in a civil action asserting claims for personal\ninjury or property damage caused by an artificial intelligence model or\nartificial intelligence application, it is an affirmative defense to liability\nthat the artificial intelligence model or artificial intelligence application\nin question was certified by an MRO at the time of the plaintiff 's injuries._\n\n~~Existing law, the Occupational Therapy Practice Act, establishes the\nCalifornia Board of Occupational Therapy for the licensure and regulation of\nthe practice of occupational therapy. Existing law prohibits a person from\npracticing occupational therapy or working as an occupational therapy\nassistant under the supervision of an occupational therapist without being\nlicensed under the act.~~\n\n~~Existing law requires an occupational therapist to document the occupational\ntherapist 's evaluation, goals, treatment plan, and summary of treatment in\nthe client record. Existing law further requires client records to be\nmaintained for a period of not less than 7 years following the discharge of\nthe client, except as specified.~~\n\n~~This bill would increase the above timeframe to 10 years following discharge\nof the client.~~\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\n_SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:_\n\n_(a) A multistakeholder regulatory organization (MRO) tasked with defining\nstandards based on best practices and certifying adherence to them is an\nagile, public-private model designed to promote innovation, ensure the\nsecurity of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, reduce regulatory\nuncertainty, and build societal trust._\n\n_(b) By proactively setting clear standards, creating tailored pathways for\nboth established companies and emerging developers, and offering legal and\neconomic incentives, the MRO transforms compliance into a competitive\nadvantage. It is not just about managing risks; it is about accelerating\nresponsible growth and empowering businesses to confidently innovate and\nthrive in an AI-driven economy. Compliance with established standards confers\na strong market advantage._\n\n_(c) Leveraging private sector and government cooperation to achieve what\nwould otherwise require regulations is a proven approach that utilizes all\navailable expertise while enhancing transparency among industry players,\npolicymakers, and the public._\n\n_(d) Rather than relying on government agencies, semiprivate standards\norganizations with sector-specific expertise can better accommodate diverse\nmarket participants, varied technology use cases, and aligned public-private\ninterests. This approach creates an adaptable and predictable compliance\nmechanism that ensures AI governance standards can evolve quickly alongside\ntechnological advancements._\n\n_(e) Legal safeguards are effective means to incentivize responsible AI\ndevelopment and prevent unnecessary harm. Reducing litigation risk encourages\ninvestment and fosters innovation. It also promotes heightened care and\nadherence to best practices while maintaining accountability and effectively\nbalancing risk mitigation with consumer and public protection._\n\n_(f) Public opinion research shows that while the public wants government to\nhelp establish guardrails for AI, a majority believe the government alone is\nincapable of effectively establishing these guardrails. An MRO surpasses\ntraditional regulation by incentivizing a race to the top for transparency and\nsafety that prioritizes innovation and adaptability and serves as a central,\ninformed voice to governments and society for responsive, forward-looking\ngovernance._\n\n_SEC. 2.

Multistakeholder regulatory organizations.\n\nExisting law requires, on or before September 1, 2024, the Department of\nTechnology to conduct, in coordination with other interagency bodies as it\ndeems appropriate, a comprehensive inventory of all high-risk automated\ndecision systems that have been proposed for use, development, or procurement\nby, or are being used, developed, or procured by, any state agency. The\nCalifornia AI Transparency Act requires a covered provider, as defined, of a\ngenerative artificial intelligence (GenAI) system to offer the user the option\nto include a manifest disclosure in image, video, or audio content, or content\nthat is any combination thereof, created or altered by the covered provider's\nGenAI system that, among other things, identifies content as AI-generated\ncontent.\n\nThis bill would establish a process by which the Attorney General designates,\nfor a renewable period of 3 years, a private entity as a multistakeholder\nregulatory organization (MRO) if that entity meets certain requirements,\nincluding that the entity presents a plan that ensures acceptable mitigation\nof risk from any MRO-certified artificial intelligence models and artificial\nintelligence applications. The bill would require an applicant for designation\nby the Attorney General as an MRO to submit with its application a plan that\ncontains certain elements, including the applicant's approach to mitigating\nspecific high-impact risks, including cybersecurity, chemical, biological,\nradiological, and nuclear threats, malign persuasion, and artificial\nintelligence model autonomy and exfiltration._The bill would require the\nAttorney General to adopt regulations, with input from stakeholders, that\nestablish minimum requirements for those plans and conflict of interest rules\nfor MROs, as specified._\n\nThis bill would require an MRO to perform various responsibilities related to\ncertifying the safety of artificial intelligence models and artificial\nintelligence applications, including decertifying an artificial intelligence\nmodel or artificial intelligence application that does not meet the\nrequirements prescribed by the MRO and submitting an annual report to the\nLegislature and the Attorney General that addresses, among other things, the\nadequacy of existing evaluation resources and mitigation measures to mitigate\nobserved and potential risks.\n\n_This bill would authorize the Attorney General to establish a fee structure\nfor charging fees to applicants and designated MROs to offset the reasonable\ncosts incurred by the Attorney General in carrying out its duties pursuant to\nthe bill and adopt regulations necessary to administer the bill._\n\nThis bill~~would provide that in a civil action asserting claims for personal\ninjury or property damage caused by an artificial intelligence model or\nartificial intelligence application, it is an affirmative defense to liability\nthat the artificial intelligence model or artificial intelligence application\nin question was certified by an MRO at the time of the plaintiff 's\ninjuries.~~ _would, in a civil action asserting claims for personal injury or\nproperty damage caused by an artificial intelligence model or artificial\nintelligence application against a developer of the artificial intelligence\nmodel or artificial intelligence application, create a rebuttable presumption\nthat the developer exercised reasonable care if the artificial intelligence\nmodel or artificial intelligence application in question was certified by an\nMRO at the time of the plaintiff 's injuries, as specified._\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nNO Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\n\n(a) A multistakeholder regulatory organization (MRO) tasked with defining\nstandards based on best practices and certifying adherence to them is an\nagile, public-private model designed to promote innovation, ensure the\nsecurity of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, reduce regulatory\nuncertainty, and build societal trust.\n\n(b) By proactively setting clear standards, creating tailored pathways for\nboth established companies and emerging developers, and offering legal and\neconomic incentives, the MRO transforms compliance into a competitive\nadvantage. It is not just about managing risks; it is about accelerating\nresponsible growth and empowering businesses to confidently innovate and\nthrive in an AI-driven economy. Compliance with established standards confers\na strong market advantage.\n\n(c) Leveraging private sector and government cooperation to achieve what would\notherwise require regulations is a proven approach that utilizes all available\nexpertise while enhancing transparency among industry players, policymakers,\nand the public.\n\n(d) Rather than relying on government agencies, semiprivate standards\norganizations with sector-specific expertise can better accommodate diverse\nmarket participants, varied technology use cases, and aligned public-private\ninterests. This approach creates an adaptable and predictable compliance\nmechanism that ensures AI governance standards can evolve quickly alongside\ntechnological advancements.\n\n(e) Legal safeguards are effective means to incentivize responsible AI\ndevelopment and prevent unnecessary harm. Reducing litigation risk encourages\ninvestment and fosters innovation. It also promotes heightened care and\nadherence to best practices while maintaining accountability and effectively\nbalancing risk mitigation with consumer and public protection.\n\n(f) Public opinion research shows that while the public wants government to\nhelp establish guardrails for AI, a majority believe the government alone is\nincapable of effectively establishing these guardrails. An MRO surpasses\ntraditional regulation by incentivizing a race to the top for transparency and\nsafety that prioritizes innovation and adaptability and serves as a central,\ninformed voice to governments and society for responsive, forward-looking\ngovernance.\n\nSEC. 2.
