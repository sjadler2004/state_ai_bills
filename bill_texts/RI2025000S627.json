It\nwould require developers, integrators, and deployers to use reasonable care to\nprevent algorithmic discrimination, implement risk management policies,\nconduct regular impact assessments, and provide transparency regarding the use\nof AI systems. The act also would require developers to disclose known risks\nto the attorney general and affected parties, while deployers are required to\nnotify consumers when AI is used in decision-making and offer avenues to\nappeal adverse outcomes. The act would further mandates that synthetic digital\ncontent generated by AI be clearly marked, with exceptions for informational\ncontent. Additionally, this act would provide exemptions for AI systems\ngoverned by equivalent federal standards, used for internal business purposes,\nor developed for specific federal agencies. The attorney general would hold\nexclusive enforcement authority, with a focus on encouraging compliance before\npursuing legal action.\n\nThis act would take effect on October 1, 2025\n\nCopyright (C) 2025 State Net  \n  \n---\n\n",
