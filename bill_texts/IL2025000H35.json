AI system\nincludes artificial intelligence.\n\n\"AI systems program\" means the health insurance issuer's controls and\nprocesses for the responsible use of AI systems, including governance, risk\nmanagement, and internal audit functions, which take into account third-party\nAI systems and data.\n\n\"Algorithm\" means a clearly specified mathematical process for computation and\na set of rules that, if followed, will give a prescribed result.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence\" or \"AI\" has the meaning given to the term\n\"artificial intelligence\" in Section 2-101 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\n\"Company\" has the meaning given to that term in Section 2 of the Illinois\nInsurance Code.\n\n\"Department\" means the Department of Insurance.\n\n\"Health insurance coverage\" has the meaning given to that term in Section 5 of\nthe Illinois Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \"Health\ninsurance coverage\" includes excepted benefits under the Department's\njurisdiction other than insurance under the Illinois Insurance Code that falls\noutside Class 1(b) or 2(a) of Section 4 of that Code.\n\n\"Health insurance issuer\" has the meaning given to that term in Section 5 of\nthe Illinois Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \"Health\ninsurance issuer\" includes a company offering accident and health insurance\nunder Class 1(b) or 2(a) of Section 4 of the Illinois Insurance Code, a dental\nservice plan corporation, a health maintenance organization, a limited health\nservice organization, a limited health services organization, or a health\nservices plan corporation transacting or authorized to transact business under\nthe Department's jurisdiction.\n\n\"Machine learning\" means a field within artificial intelligence that focuses\non the ability of computers to learn from provided data without being\nexplicitly programmed.\n\n\"Predictive model\" means the processing of historic data using algorithms or\nmachine learning to identify patterns and predict outcomes that can be used to\nmake decisions or support decision-making.\n\n\"Third party\" means an organization other than the health insurance issuer\nthat provides services, data, or other resources related to AI, including any\nperson who develops or uses AI to support the health insurance issuer in\nadministering its health insurance coverage.\n\nSection 10. Regulatory oversight of the use of AI systems.\n\n(a) The Department's regulatory oversight of health insurance coverage\nincludes oversight of the use of AI systems or predictive models to make or\nsupport adverse consumer outcomes. The Department's authority in an\ninvestigation or market conduct action includes review regarding the\ndevelopment, implementation, and use of AI systems or predictive models and\nthe outcomes from the use of those AI systems or predictive models. The\nDepartment may also request other information or documentation relevant to an\ninvestigation or market conduct action, and a health insurance issuer or any\nother person described in subsection (b) of Section 132 of the Illinois\nInsurance Code must comply with that request. The Department's inquiries may\ninclude, but are not limited to, questions regarding any specific model, AI\nsystem, or application of a model or AI system. The Department may also make\nrequests for information and documentation relating to AI systems governance,\nrisk management, and use protocols; information and documentation relating to\nthe health insurance issuer's preacquisition and preutilization diligence,\nmonitoring, and auditing of data or AI systems developed or used by a third\nparty; and information and documentation relating to implementation and\ncompliance with the health insurance issuer's AI systems program.\n\n(b) A health insurance issuer authorized to do business in this State shall\nnot issue an adverse consumer outcome with regard to the denial, reduction, or\ntermination of health insurance coverage or benefits that result solely from\nthe use or application of any AI system or predictive model. Any decision-\nmaking process concerning the denial, reduction, or termination of insurance\nplans or benefits that results from the use of AI systems or predictive models\nshall be meaningfully reviewed, in accordance with review procedures\nestablished by Department rules, by an individual with authority to override\nthe AI systems and the determinations of the AI systems.
