(a) All carriers licensed under chapters 175, 176A, 176B and 176G that provide medical or prescription drug benefits subject to utilization review consistent with section 12 of chapter 176O, shall make publicly available on their website a searchable list of all items, services and medications that require prior authorization.

Chapter 32A of the General Laws, as appearing in the 2022 Official Edition, is hereby amended by inserting after section 4B the following section:-</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Section 4C. The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits, shall adopt utilization review criteria and conduct all utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section. The criteria shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, scientifically derived and evidence-based, and developed with the input of participating physicians. Utilization review criteria, including detailed preauthorization requirements and clinical review criteria, shall be applied consistently and posted on a publicly-available website by the commission or any entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits in an up-to-date, readily accessible, standardized and searchable electronic format. If the commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits intends either to implement a new preauthorization requirement or restriction or amend an existing requirement or restriction, the new or amended requirement or restriction shall not be implemented unless: (i) the appropriate website has been updated to reflect the new or amended requirement or restriction; (ii) active or retired employees of the commonwealth and their dependents who are affected are notified of the changes by electronic means via email and any applicable online member portal, or for those without access to electronic means of communication, by mail; and (iii) the commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits has processes in place to ensure continuation of any previously approved preauthorizations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">The commission or an entity with which the commission contracts to provide or manage health insurance benefits shall not retrospectively deny authorization for an admission, procedure, treatment, service or course of medication when an authorization has already been approved for that service unless the approval was based upon fraudulent information material to the review.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 3. Section 24B of chapter 175, as so appearing, is hereby amended by adding the following paragraphs:-</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A carrier, as defined in section 1 of chapter 176O, shall be required to pay for health care services ordered by the treating health care provider if: (1) the services are a covered benefit under the insured&rsquo;s health benefit plan; and (2) the services follow the carrier&rsquo;s clinical review criteria; provided, however, that a claim for treatment of medically necessary services may not be denied if the treating health care provider follows the carrier&rsquo;s approved method for securing authorization for a covered service for the insured at the time the service was provided. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A carrier shall not deny payment for a claim for medically necessary covered services on the basis of an administrative or technical defect in the claim except in the case where the carrier has a reasonable basis, supported by specific information available for review, that the claim for health care services rendered was submitted fraudulently. A carrier shall have no more than 1 year after the original payment was received by the health care provider to recoup a full or partial payment for a claim for services rendered, or to adjust a subsequent payment to reflect a recoupment of a full or partial payment. Claims may not be recouped for utilization review purposes if the services were already deemed medically necessary or the manner in which the services were accessed or provided were previously approved by the carrier or its contractor. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 4. Subsection (a) of section 12 of chapter 176O, as so appearing, is hereby amended by striking out the second paragraph and inserting in place thereof the following paragraph:-</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">A carrier or utilization review organization shall adopt utilization review criteria and conduct all utilization review activities under the criteria and in compliance with this section.

If a carrier or utilization review organization does not, within the time limits set forth in this section, respond to a completed prior authorization request or request missing information, the prior authorization request shall be deemed to have been granted; provided further that if a prior authorization is requested for an item, service, or medication that is not publicly listed on a carrier&rsquo;s website as being subject to prior authorization, the request shall be deemed to have been granted.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 7. Said section 12 of said chapter 176O, as so appearing, is further amended by adding after subsection (f) the following subsections:- </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(g) For an insured member who is stable on a treatment, service or course of medication as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by a previous carrier or health benefit plan, a carrier or utilization review organization shall not restrict coverage of such treatment, service or course of medication for at least 90 days upon the insured member&rsquo;s enrollment.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(h) Preauthorization approval for a prescribed treatment, service or course of medication shall be valid for the duration of a prescribed or ordered course of treatment, or at least 1 year; provided further that a change in dosage for an approved medication shall not require a new preauthorization.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(i) For an insured member who is stable on a treatment, service or course of medication as determined by a health care provider and approved for coverage by the carrier or health benefit plan, and where that drug or medical service is then removed from a plan&rsquo;s formulary or is subject to new coverage restrictions after the beneficiary enrollment period has ended, a carrier shall cover the approved drug or medical service without restrictions for the rest of the benefit year or 90 days, whichever is longer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(j) If a carrier and a provider or provider organization are engaged in an alternative payment contract that includes downside risk, the carrier shall not unilaterally require prior authorization requirements for any particular health care service that is included in that alternative payment contract.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 8.

If the carrier does not come into compliance by adhering to the corrective action plan within a period determined by the commissioner, the carrier shall be fined up to $5,000 for each day during which such violation continues; provided, however, that the commissioner may impose additional penalties for repeated or wanton violations.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 9.
