The commissioner may refer cases of noncompliance to the\nfederal department of health and human services under the terms of a\ncollaborative enforcement agreement, or to the attorney general.\n\nUnder current law, an independent review organization (IRO) required to\nmaintain written records shall submit a report to the commissioner upon\nrequest. Under the bill, an IRO required to maintain written records shall\nannually submit a report to the commissioner. The commissioner shall make the\nIRO reports publicly accessible on the division's internet site.\n\nUnder current law, each carrier required to maintain written records of\nrequests for external review shall submit a report to the commissioner upon\nrequest. Under the bill, each carrier required to maintain written records of\nrequests for external review shall annually submit a report to the\ncommissioner.
