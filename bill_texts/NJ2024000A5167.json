Specifically, the bill establishes three distinct programs within the authority to support these purposes and appropriates a sum of $175.5 million to support these programs.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">AI Job Creation and Economic Development Fund Program</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> First, the bill establishes the &quot;AI Job Creation and Economic Development Fund Program&quot; within the authority to support the establishment, expansion, or improved operations of AI businesses in the State and to support the development of AI innovation hubs by AI businesses in the State.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Under the program, the authority would provide: (1) grants of up to $500,000 to AI businesses that seek to develop AI innovation hubs in the State; and (2) low-interest loans of up to $1 million to AI businesses that seek to establish, expand, or improve business operations in the State.

However, any grant awarded to a recipient would not be: (1) less than $50,000 or greater than $250,000 for research and product development purposes; (2) less than $250,000 or greater than $1 million for business expansion purposes; or (3) less than $10,000 or greater than $20,000 for job creation purposes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill appropriates $150 million from the General Fund to the authority to support this program. Beginning one year after the establishment of the grant program and each year thereafter until all funds deposited into the AI for Small Business Grant Program Fund have been expended, the authority would be required to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature on the number of applications submitted during the previous year, and the amount awarded to each grant recipient for that year.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Lastly, the bill also establishes the &quot;AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program,&quot; which would be administered by the authority, in consultation with the New Jersey Chief Technology Officer.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Under the program, the authority would provide consultancy services and technical assistance to small and medium-sized businesses, upon application to the authority, in identifying and implementing the artificial intelligence technologies and tools that support the business development and growth plan identified in the business&#39;s application to the program. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The program would be administered by a manager, appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority, qualified by work in artificial intelligence development activities or its equivalent in training and experience. As part of the program manager&#39;s duties, the person would establish and update, as necessary, a database listing the availability of qualified artificial intelligence professionals, businesses, research institutions, industry networks, academic networks, technologies, and tools in the State. The database would be published and maintained on the official Internet website of the authority.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The bill appropriates $500,000 from the General Fund to the authority for the purposes of establishing and administering the AI for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Consultancy Program.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",
