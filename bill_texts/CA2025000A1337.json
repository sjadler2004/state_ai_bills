Information Practices Act of 1977.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of requirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined, with regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act counties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal corporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public agencies, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that exemption for local agencies. The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of records containing personal information and instruct those persons with respect to specified rules relevant to the act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require that those rules established by the agency be consistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and the State Information Management Manual. The bill would prohibit an agency from using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes other than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was collected, except as required by state or federal law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a manner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, except under specified circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of personal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of any rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of any agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for discipline. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric, or psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the act, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if the wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the individual to whom the information pertains.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in economic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

The Legislature finds and declares that Sections 1 and 6 of this act, which amend Sections 1798.3 and 1798.24 of the Civil Code, imposes a limitation on the public&#39;s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">By modernizing provisions of the Information Practices Act of 1977 to address the effects of advances in information technology on the scope and sensitivity of personal information collected, maintained, and disseminated by state agencies, this act balances the right to access information concerning the conduct of the people&#39;s business with the individual right to privacy.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SEC. 17. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution for certain costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district because, in that regard, this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIIIB of the California Constitution.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">However, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains other costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.</p>\n  </div>\n </div>\n    </div>\t\n<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=\"100%\">\n   <tr>\n      <td>\n          Copyright &copy; 2025 State Net\n      </td>\n<BR>\n<!--???MOVED INTO resources.cgi      <td align=\"right\">\n          <img src=\"https://custom.statenet.com/network/poweredby.gif\" alt=\"Powered by State Net\">\n      </td>-->\n\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</body></html>\n",

Information Practices Act of 1977.\n\nExisting law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of\nrequirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined,\nwith regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal\ninformation, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act\ncounties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal\ncorporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public\nagencies, as specified.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that\nexemption for local agencies. The bill would make other technical,\nnonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the\nduties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local\nprogram.\n\nExisting law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons\ninvolved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of\nrecords containing personal information and instruct those persons with\nrespect to specified rules relevant to the act.\n\nThis bill would require that those rules established by the agency be\nconsistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and\nthe State Information Management Manual. The bill would prohibit an agency\nfrom using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes\nother than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was\ncollected, except as required by state or federal law.\n\nExisting law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a\nmanner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it\npertains, except under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of\npersonal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to\nthe individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.\n\nExisting law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of\nany rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of\nany agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment.\n\nThis bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for\ndiscipline.\n\nExisting law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric,\nor psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the\nact, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if\nthe wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the\nindividual to whom the information pertains.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in\neconomic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of\nan existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-\nmandated local program.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the\nright of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public\nofficials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest\nprotected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement\nis required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the\nCommission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so\nmandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to\nthe statutory provisions noted above.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

This article applies to the rights of an individual to whom personal\ninformation pertains and not to the authority or right of any other person,\nagency,~~other state governmental entity,~~ _agency of another state,_\nor~~governmental entity~~ _branch of the federal government_ to obtain this\ninformation.\n\nSEC. 13. Section 1798.55 of the Civil Code is amended to read:\n\n1798.55.

Information Practices Act of 1977.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of requirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined, with regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act counties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal corporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public agencies, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that exemption for local<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> agencies.</strike>\n    <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> agencies, and would revise and expand the definition of &quot;personal information.&quot;</u> The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of records containing personal information and instruct those persons with respect to specified rules relevant to the act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would require that those rules established by the agency be consistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and the State Information Management Manual. The bill would prohibit an agency from using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes other than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was collected, except as required by state or federal law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a manner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, except under specified circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of personal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of any rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of any agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for discipline. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric, or psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the act, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if the wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the individual to whom the information pertains.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in economic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">With regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Vote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current Expenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO </p>\n  </div>\n  <a name=\"text_document_section\"></a><div class=\"text\">\n   <span>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The people of the State of California do enact as follows:</p>\n   </span>\n   <p class=\"indent\">SECTION 1.

Section 1798.55 of the Civil Code is amended to read:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">1798.55.

Information Practices Act of 1977.\n\nExisting law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of\nrequirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined,\nwith regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal\ninformation, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act\ncounties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal\ncorporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public\nagencies, as specified.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that\nexemption for local~~agencies.~~ _agencies, and would revise and expand the\ndefinition of \"personal information.\"_ The bill would make other technical,\nnonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the\nduties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local\nprogram.\n\nExisting law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons\ninvolved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of\nrecords containing personal information and instruct those persons with\nrespect to specified rules relevant to the act.\n\nThis bill would require that those rules established by the agency be\nconsistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and\nthe State Information Management Manual. The bill would prohibit an agency\nfrom using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes\nother than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was\ncollected, except as required by state or federal law.\n\nExisting law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a\nmanner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it\npertains, except under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of\npersonal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to\nthe individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.\n\nExisting law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of\nany rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of\nany agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment.\n\nThis bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for\ndiscipline.\n\nExisting law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric,\nor psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the\nact, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if\nthe wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the\nindividual to whom the information pertains.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in\neconomic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of\nan existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-\nmandated local program.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the\nright of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public\nofficials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest\nprotected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement\nis required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the\nCommission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so\nmandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to\nthe statutory provisions noted above.\n\nVote Required: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program:\nYES Immediate Effect NO Urgency: NO Tax Levy: NO Election: NO Usual Current\nExpenses: NO Budget Bill: NO Prop 25 Trailer Bill: NO\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

Information Practices Act of 1977.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of requirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined, with regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act counties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal corporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public agencies, as specified.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that exemption for local agencies, and would revise and expand the definition of &quot;personal information.&quot; The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive, and conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of records containing personal information and instruct those persons with respect to specified rules relevant to the act.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> require that those rules established by the agency be consistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and the State Information Management Manual. The bill would</strike> prohibit an agency from using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes other than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was collected, except as required<u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\"> or authorized</u> by state<strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\"> or federal</strike> law.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a manner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, except under specified circumstances.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of personal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of any rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of any agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for discipline. </p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">Existing law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric, or psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the act, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if the wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the individual to whom the information pertains.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in economic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of an existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\"> The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

Information Practices Act of 1977.\n\nExisting law, the Information Practices Act of 1977, prescribes a set of\nrequirements, prohibitions, and remedies applicable to agencies, as defined,\nwith regard to their collection, storage, and disclosure of personal\ninformation, as defined. Existing law exempts from the provisions of the act\ncounties, cities, any city and county, school districts, municipal\ncorporations, districts, political subdivisions, and other local public\nagencies, as specified.\n\nThis bill would recast those provisions to, among other things, remove that\nexemption for local agencies, and would revise and expand the definition of\n\"personal information.\" The bill would make other technical, nonsubstantive,\nand conforming changes. Because the bill would expand the duties of local\nofficials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n\nExisting law requires an agency to establish rules of conduct for persons\ninvolved in the design, development, operation, disclosure, or maintenance of\nrecords containing personal information and instruct those persons with\nrespect to specified rules relevant to the act.\n\nThis bill would~~require that those rules established by the agency be\nconsistent with applicable provisions of the State Administrative Manual and\nthe State Information Management Manual. The bill would~~ prohibit an agency\nfrom using records containing personal information for any purpose or purposes\nother than the purpose or purposes for which that personal information was\ncollected, except as required _or authorized_ by state~~or federal~~ law.\n\nExisting law prohibits an agency from disclosing any personal information in a\nmanner that would link the information disclosed to the individual to whom it\npertains, except under specified circumstances.\n\nThis bill would revise the circumstances that may allow the disclosure of\npersonal information in a manner that could link the information disclosed to\nthe individual to whom it pertains, and would make conforming changes.\n\nExisting law makes an intentional violation of any provision of the act, or of\nany rules or regulations adopted under the act, by an officer or employee of\nany agency a cause for discipline, including termination of employment.\n\nThis bill would also make a negligent violation of the act a cause for\ndiscipline.\n\nExisting law provides that the intentional disclosure of medical, psychiatric,\nor psychological information in violation of the disclosure provisions of the\nact, that is not otherwise permitted by law, is punishable as a misdemeanor if\nthe wrongful disclosure results in economic loss or personal injury to the\nindividual to whom the information pertains.\n\nThis bill would remove the requirement that the wrongful disclosure result in\neconomic loss or personal injury. Because the bill would expand the scope of\nan existing crime by deleting this condition, the bill would impose a state-\nmandated local program.\n\nExisting constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the\nright of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public\nofficials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest\nprotected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\n\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n\nThe California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and\nschool districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions\nestablish procedures for making that reimbursement.\n\nThis bill would provide that with regard to certain mandates no reimbursement\nis required by this act for a specified reason.\n\nWith regard to any other mandates, this bill would provide that, if the\nCommission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs so\nmandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to\nthe statutory provisions noted above.\n\nVote: MAJORITY Appropriation: NO Fiscal Committee: YES Local Program: YES\n\nThe people of the State of California do enact as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.
