It is the policy of the state that each district school superintendent be responsible for enforcing school attendance of all students subject to the compulsory school age in the school district and supporting enforcement of school attendance by local law enforcement agencies. The responsibility includes recommending policies and procedures to the district school board that require public schools to respond in a timely manner to every unexcused absence, and every absence for which the reason is unknown, of students enrolled in the schools. District school board policies shall require the parent of a student to justify each absence of the student, and that justification will be evaluated based on adopted district school board policies that define excused and unexcused absences. The policies must provide that public schools track excused and unexcused absences and contact the home in the case of an unexcused absence from school, or an absence from school for which the reason is unknown, to prevent the development of patterns of nonattendance. The Legislature finds that early intervention in school attendance is the most effective way of producing good attendance habits that will lead to improved student learning and achievement. Each public school shall implement the following steps to promote and enforce regular school attendance:</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(1) CONTACT, REFER, AND ENFORCE.&mdash;</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">(b) If a student has had at least five unexcused absences, or absences for which the reasons are unknown, within a calendar month or 10 unexcused absences, or absences for which the reasons are unknown, within a 90-calendar-day period, <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">or a period of time less than 90 days as determined by the district school board,</u> the student&#39;s primary teacher <u class=\"amendmentInsertedText\">must</u>\n    <strike class=\"amendmentDeletedText\">shall</strike> report to the school principal or his or her designee that the student may be exhibiting a pattern of nonattendance.

Subsection (4) of section 1003.03, Florida Statutes, is amended to\nread:\n\n1003.03 Maximum class size.--\n\n~~(4) ACCOUNTABILITY. --Each district that has not complied with the\nrequirements in subsection (1), based on the October student membership\nsurvey, shall submit to the commissioner by February 1 a plan certified by the\ndistrict school board that describes the specific actions the district will\ntake in order to fully comply with the requirements in subsection (1) by\nOctober of the following school year.~~\n\nSection 14. Paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section 1003.26, Florida\nStatutes, is amended to read:\n\n1003.26 Enforcement of school attendance.--The Legislature finds that poor\nacademic performance is associated with nonattendance and that school\ndistricts must take an active role in promoting and enforcing attendance as a\nmeans of improving student performance. It is the policy of the state that\neach district school superintendent be responsible for enforcing school\nattendance of all students subject to the compulsory school age in the school\ndistrict and supporting enforcement of school attendance by local law\nenforcement agencies. The responsibility includes recommending policies and\nprocedures to the district school board that require public schools to respond\nin a timely manner to every unexcused absence, and every absence for which the\nreason is unknown, of students enrolled in the schools. District school board\npolicies shall require the parent of a student to justify each absence of the\nstudent, and that justification will be evaluated based on adopted district\nschool board policies that define excused and unexcused absences. The policies\nmust provide that public schools track excused and unexcused absences and\ncontact the home in the case of an unexcused absence from school, or an\nabsence from school for which the reason is unknown, to prevent the\ndevelopment of patterns of nonattendance. The Legislature finds that early\nintervention in school attendance is the most effective way of producing good\nattendance habits that will lead to improved student learning and achievement.\nEach public school shall implement the following steps to promote and enforce\nregular school attendance:\n\n(1) CONTACT, REFER, AND ENFORCE.--\n\n(b) If a student has had at least five unexcused absences, or absences for\nwhich the reasons are unknown, within a calendar month or 10 unexcused\nabsences, or absences for which the reasons are unknown, within a 90-calendar-\nday period, _or a period of time less than 90 days as determined by the\ndistrict school board,_ the student's primary teacher _must_ ~~shall~~ report\nto the school principal or his or her designee that the student may be\nexhibiting a pattern of nonattendance. The principal shall, unless there is\nclear evidence that the absences are not a pattern of nonattendance, refer the\ncase to the school's child study team to determine if early patterns of\ntruancy are developing. If the child study team finds that a pattern of\nnonattendance is developing, whether the absences are excused or not, a\nmeeting with the parent must be scheduled to identify potential remedies, and\nthe principal _must_ ~~shall~~ notify the district school superintendent and\nthe school district contact for home education programs that the referred\nstudent is exhibiting a pattern of nonattendance.\n\nSection 15.

The principal shall, unless there is\nclear evidence that the absences are not a pattern of nonattendance, refer the\ncase to the school's child study team to determine if early patterns of\ntruancy are developing. If the child study team finds that a pattern of\nnonattendance is developing, whether the absences are excused or not, a\nmeeting with the parent must be scheduled to identify potential remedies, and\nthe principal _must_ ~~shall~~ notify the district school superintendent and\nthe school district contact for home education programs that the referred\nstudent is exhibiting a pattern of nonattendance.\n\nSection 15.

The school board 's\nplan for provision of new schools must meet the needs of all growing\ncommunities in the district, ranging from small rural communities to large\nurban cities. The plan must include:~~\n\n~~1\\. Projected student populations apportioned geographically at the local\nlevel. The projections must be based on information produced by the\ndemographic, revenue, and education estimating conferences pursuant to s.\n216.136, where available, as modified by the district based on development\ndata and agreement with the local governments and the Office of Educational\nFacilities. The projections must be apportioned geographically with assistance\nfrom the local governments using local development trend data and the school\ndistrict student enrollment data.~~\n\n~~2\\. An inventory of existing school facilities. Any anticipated expansions\nor closures of existing school sites over the 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year\nperiods must be identified. The inventory must include an assessment of areas\nproximate to existing schools and identification of the need for improvements\nto infrastructure, safety, including safe access routes, and conditions in the\ncommunity. The plan must also provide a listing of major repairs and\nrenovation projects anticipated over the period of the plan.~~\n\n~~3\\. Projections of facilities space needs, which may not exceed the norm\nspace and occupant design criteria established in the State Requirements for\nEducational Facilities.~~\n\n~~4\\.

It is the policy of the state that each district school superintendent be responsible for enforcing school attendance of all students subject to the compulsory school age in the school district and supporting enforcement of school attendance by local law enforcement agencies. The responsibility includes recommending policies and procedures to the district school board that require public schools to respond in a timely manner to every unexcused absence, and every absence for which the reason is unknown, of students enrolled in the schools. District school board policies shall require the parent of a student to justify each absence of the student, and that justification will be evaluated based on adopted district school board policies that define excused and unexcused absences. The policies must provide that public schools track excused and unexcused absences and contact the home in the case of an unexcused absence from school, or an absence from school for which the reason is unknown, to prevent the development of patterns of nonattendance. The Legislature finds that early intervention in school attendance is the most effective way of producing good attendance habits that will lead to improved student learning and achievement.

District school board\npolicies shall require the parent of a student to justify each absence of the\nstudent, and that justification will be evaluated based on adopted district\nschool board policies that define excused and unexcused absences. The policies\nmust provide that public schools track excused and unexcused absences and\ncontact the home in the case of an unexcused absence from school, or an\nabsence from school for which the reason is unknown, to prevent the\ndevelopment of patterns of nonattendance. The Legislature finds that early\nintervention in school attendance is the most effective way of producing good\nattendance habits that will lead to improved student learning and achievement.\nEach public school shall implement the following steps to promote and enforce\nregular school attendance:\n\n(1) CONTACT, REFER, AND ENFORCE.--\n\n(b) If a student has had at least five unexcused absences, or absences for\nwhich the reasons are unknown, within a calendar month or 10 unexcused\nabsences, or absences for which the reasons are unknown, within a 90-calendar-\nday period, _or a period of time less than 90 days as determined by the\ndistrict school board,_ the student's primary teacher _must_ ~~shall~~ report\nto the school principal or his or her designee that the student may be\nexhibiting a pattern of nonattendance.

It is the policy of the state that\neach district school superintendent be responsible for enforcing school\nattendance of all students subject to the compulsory school age in the school\ndistrict and supporting enforcement of school attendance by local law\nenforcement agencies. The responsibility includes recommending policies and\nprocedures to the district school board that require public schools to respond\nin a timely manner to every unexcused absence, and every absence for which the\nreason is unknown, of students enrolled in the schools. District school board\npolicies shall require the parent of a student to justify each absence of the\nstudent, and that justification will be evaluated based on adopted district\nschool board policies that define excused and unexcused absences. The policies\nmust provide that public schools track excused and unexcused absences and\ncontact the home in the case of an unexcused absence from school, or an\nabsence from school for which the reason is unknown, to prevent the\ndevelopment of patterns of nonattendance. The Legislature finds that early\nintervention in school attendance is the most effective way of producing good\nattendance habits that will lead to improved student learning and achievement.\nEach public school shall implement the following steps to promote and enforce\nregular school attendance:\n\n(1) CONTACT, REFER, AND ENFORCE. --\n\n(b) If a student has had at least five unexcused absences, or absences for\nwhich the reasons are unknown, within a calendar month or 10 unexcused\nabsences, or absences for which the reasons are unknown, within a 90-calendar-\nday period, _or a period of time less than 90 days as determined by the\ndistrict school board,_ the student's primary teacher _must_ ~~shall~~ report\nto the school principal or his or her designee that the student may be\nexhibiting a pattern of nonattendance. The principal shall, unless there is\nclear evidence that the absences are not a pattern of nonattendance, refer the\ncase to the school's child study team to determine if early patterns of\ntruancy are developing. If the child study team finds that a pattern of\nnonattendance is developing, whether the absences are excused or not, a\nmeeting with the parent must be scheduled to identify potential remedies, and\nthe principal _must_ ~~shall~~ notify the district school superintendent and\nthe school district contact for home education programs that the referred\nstudent is exhibiting a pattern of nonattendance.\n\nSection 15.
