and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, a 2022 report by the center for audit quality revealed significant barriers to the pursuit of accounting careers, with a thirty-six percent decline in the certified public accounting examination pass rate between 2010 and 2021 and nearly seventy-five percent of the certified public accountant workforce reaching retirement age in 2020; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, over three hundred thousand certified public accountants and auditors in the United States have left the field over the past two years, a seventeen percent decline, compounded by fewer college students entering the profession, and finding and retaining qualified staff continues to be a top challenge for accounting employers;

and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the American institute of certified public accountants supports federal legislation recognizing accounting as a STEM career to diversify the workforce, with legislation introduced to fund K-12 accounting education, as STEM recognition at the K-12 level will help expand the certified public accountant talent pipeline and introduce diverse students to accounting careers; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, the growing integration of technology in accounting drives demand for certified public accountants with strong analytical and data-driven skills, aligning with STEM education; and</p>\n   <p class=\"indent\">WHEREAS, artificial intelligence, analytics and technology require a workforce with STEM skills to enable accountants to leverage data and technology for strategic problem-solving;

the expansion of the workforce solutions department&#39;s workkeys program to assess artificial intelligence, STEM and accounting competencies, including a career readiness certificate to confirm artificial intelligence and STEM skills for employers;
